<h3>Homework - Week 5</h3>
<ul>
<li>Will be due Monday at 11:59pm</li>
<li>We continued to provide scaffolded code in <code>homework-05.qmd</code></li>
<li>We also provided a version without scaffolded code, named <code>homework-05-blank.qmd</code>
<ul>
<li>This file will Render without any edits, unlike <code>homework-05.qmd</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> The last 1-2 questions are fairly involved. They are meant as an opportunity to practice, not a source of stress. For Prelim 1 on October 2, we will not ask you to write such long pieces of code from scratch. However, we may ask you to write short code snippets, or outline the key steps to approach a more complicated programming task conceptually (in words, not code), or both.</li>
</ul>
