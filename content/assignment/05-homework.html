<h2>Homework</h2>
<p>Navigate to <a href="http://posit.cloud">posit.cloud</a>, open the project <code>homework-05</code> in our course workspace, and follow the instructions in the file <code>homework-05.qmd</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This week we continued to provide scaffolded code in <code>homework-05.qmd</code>. However, we also provided a version without scaffolded code, named <code>homework-05-blank.qmd</code>, in case you prefer to be able to Render your file along the way without filling in all the blanks (<code>_____</code>), which cause the code to fail and therefore prevent the file from rendering.</p>
<p><strong>Strings and regular expressions will be included in prelim 1.</strong></p>
