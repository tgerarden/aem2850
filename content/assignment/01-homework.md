## Homework

This week's homework is a short survey to help us get to know you: https://forms.gle/ibzS6SVTKa5QW3GaA.

As with other homework assignments throughout the semester, it is due Monday at 11:59pm (of the week following when we cover the material). The first homework should only take a few minutes and does not require any programming.
