# What sports do we watch?

Take a guess: what's the most popular spectator sport among classmates?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
load("data/survey-responses/survey-data.RData")
n_sports <- 30
```

--

Here are the first `r n_sports` responses:
```{r, echo = FALSE}
sports[!(sports %in% c("don't really watch sports"))] |> # just for pretty printing
  head(n_sports)
```

--

Let's `count` and `arrange` to get the top 3:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tibble(sport = sports) |> # make a data frame with one column, sport
  count(sport) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |> 
  head(3)
```

---

# R can be used for sports analytics, too!

# Joins


---

# What are relational data?

--

Multiple tables of data with pairwise relations

Relations across >2 data tables are determined by the relations between each pair

---

# Relational data example: `nycflights13`

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/04/nycflights13-relational.png")
```

---

# Relational data verbs from dplyr

1. **Mutating joins**: add new variables
  - `left_join()`
  - `right_join()`
  - `inner_join()`
  - `full_join()`

2. **Filtering joins**: filter observations
  - `semi_join()`
  - `anti_join()`


<!-- --- -->

<!-- # How do join verbs work? -->


<!-- From Ivan Rudik's slides: -->

<!-- We need two datasets (e.g., housing prices and pollution) -->

<!-- Each dataset has the same set of **key** variables (e.g. county) -->

<!-- When we join, we match up the two datasets on the key, and combine them into one -->

<!-- In our housing example, each row of the joined dataset would now tell us the house price, the county it's in, and the county's pollution -->

???

# Joins

Let's learn these join commands using two small data frames

```{r echo = FALSE}
superheroes <- tibble::tribble(
       ~name, ~alignment,          ~publisher,
   "Magneto",      "bad",            "Marvel",
     "Storm",     "good",            "Marvel",
  "Mystique",      "bad",            "Marvel",
    "Batman",     "good",                "DC",
     "Joker",      "bad",                "DC",
  "Catwoman",      "bad",                "DC",
   "Hellboy",     "good", "Dark Horse Comics"
  )

publishers <- tibble::tribble(
  ~publisher, ~year_founded,
        "DC",       1934L,
    "Marvel",       1939L,
     "Image",       1992L

# 1) dplyr::left_join(x, y)

```{r ljoin}
left_join(superheroes, publishers)
```

`left_join` is a **mutating join**: it adds variables to `x`

`left_join` returns all rows from `x`

---

# 2) dplyr::right_join(x, y)

```{r rjoin}
right_join(superheroes, publishers)
```

`right_join` is a **mutating join**: it adds variables to `y`

`right_join` returns all rows from `y`

---

# 3) dplyr::inner_join(x, y)

```{r ijoin}
inner_join(superheroes, publishers)
```

How is `inner_join` different from `left_join` and `right_join`?

--

`inner_join` returns all rows in `x` **AND** `y`

---

# 4) dplyr::full_join(x, y)

```{r fjoin, eval = FALSE}
full_join(superheroes, publishers) # how many rows do you think this will produce?
```

--

```{r fjoinb, echo = FALSE}
full_join(superheroes, publishers)
```

`full_join` returns all rows in `x` **OR** `y`

---

# 5) dplyr::semi_join(x, y)

.pull-left[
```{r}
superheroes
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r sjoin}
semi_join(superheroes, publishers)
```
]

`semi_join` is a **filtering join**: it keeps observations in `x` that have a match in `y`

Note that the variables do not change

---

# 6) dplyr::anti_join(x, y)

.pull-left[
```{r}
superheroes
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ajoin}
anti_join(superheroes, publishers)
```
]

`anti_join` is a **filtering join**: it keeps obs. in `x` that **DO NOT** have a match in `y`

Note that the variables do not change


---

# Key variables

How do `dplyr` join commands know what variables to use as **keys**?

--

By default, `*_join()` uses all variables that are common across `x` and `y`
```{r}
intersect(names(superheroes), names(publishers)) # variable used for matching before
```

--

Or, we can specify what to join by: `*_join(..., by = join_by(publisher))`

.small[Note: before `dplyr` 1.1.0, the syntax was: `*_join(..., by = "publisher")`]

---

# Exploring keys

```{r flights}
library(nycflights13) # let's explore keys using the nycflights13 data
flights |> print(n = 8) # print the first 8 rows of flights
```

---

# Exploring keys

```{r planes}
planes # print the first 10 rows of planes
```

---

# Let's perform a left join on flights and planes

```{r join1}
left_join(flights, planes) |> #<<
  select(year:dep_time, arr_time, carrier:tailnum, type, model) |> # keep text to one slide
  print(n = 5) # just to save vertical space on the slide
```

--

Uh-oh! What's up with `type` and `model`?

---

# Uh-oh!

As before, `dplyr` guessed which columns to join on

It uses columns with the same name:

```
*## Joining, by = c("year", "tailnum")
```

Does anyone see a potential problem here?

--

The variable `year` does not have a consistent meaning across the datasets

--

In `flights` it refers to the *year of flight*, in `planes` it refers to *year of construction*

--

Luckily we can avoid this by using the argument `by = join_by(...)`

---

# What should we join flights and planes by?

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/04/nycflights13-relational.png")
```

---

# Specifying join keys

We just need to be explicit in the join call by using the `by` argument

```{r join2, highlight.line = 4}
left_join(flights,
          planes |> rename(year_built = year), # not necessary w/ below line, but helpful
          by = join_by(tailnum) # be specific about the joining column #<< 
          ) |>
  select(year, month:dep_time, carrier, flight, tailnum, year_built, type, model) |>
  print(n = 5) # just to save vertical space on the slide
```

---

# Specifying join keys

What happens if we don't rename `year` before this join?

```{r join2b, highlight.line = 4}
left_join(flights,
          planes, # not renaming "year" to "year_built" this time #<< 
          by = join_by(tailnum)
          ) |>
  select(contains("year"), month:dep_time, arr_time, carrier, flight, tailnum, type, model) |>
  print(n = 4) # just to save vertical space on the slide
```

--

What is `year.x`? What is `year.y`?

name: logic

# Logic


---

# Logical vectors

What are logical vectors, or logicals?

--

Logicals take on only three values: `TRUE`, `FALSE`, or `NA`

Logical vectors are just vectors ("columns") that only contain `TRUE`, `FALSE`, or `NA`

---

# Logical vectors

Can you think of any logical vectors we have worked with so far?

--

While we don't often see logical vectors in raw data, we use them all the time!

Example: every time we make comparisons to `filter()` data we create _transient_ logical variables that are computed, used, and then thrown away

---

# Transient logical vectors

We create a transient logical vector when we filter `flights` to Miami:

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
flights |> 
  select(carrier, flight, dest) |> 
  filter(dest == "MIA")
```

---

<!-- # What goes on under the hood of a filter -->

# `filter(dest == "MIA")`: under the hood

.pull-left[
```{r, highlight.output=6}
# create a logical vector from a comparison
flights |> 
  select(carrier, flight, dest) |> 
  mutate(welcome_to_miami = dest == "MIA") #<<
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r, highlight.output=4}
flights |> 
  select(carrier, flight, dest) |> 
  mutate(welcome_to_miami = dest == "MIA") |> 
  filter(welcome_to_miami) # then filter #<<
```

]

---

# Comparisons

Numeric comparisons like `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `!=`, and `==` can be used to create logical vectors

As we have seen, `==` is useful for comparing character vectors (i.e., strings)

---

# `is.na()`

`is.na()` is a useful function for checking whether something is `NA`

Why use `is.na(x)` when we could use `x == NA`?

--

```{r}
x <- 2850 + 5850
is.na(x)
```

--

```{r}
x == NA
```

May seem odd but it makes sense when you think about concrete comparisons

---
name: boolean-algebra

# Boolean algebra

Use Boolean algebra to combine comparisons / logical vectors

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/04/boolean-algebra.png")
```

???

Source: <https://r4ds.hadley.nz/logicals.html#boolean-algebra>

---

# Boolean operator examples

.pull-left[
```{r}
flights |> 
  select(carrier, flight, dest) |> 
  filter(dest == "MIA" | dest == "MYR") #<<
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
flights |> 
  select(carrier, flight, dest) |> 
  filter(carrier == "AA" & dest == "MIA") #<<
```
]

---

# %in%

`x %in% y` is a useful tool for identifying whether a value in `x` is contained in `y`

```{r eval=TRUE}
flights |> 
  select(carrier, flight, dest) |> 
  filter(dest %in% c("MIA", "MYR")) #<<
```

---

# Numeric operations on logical vectors

Numeric operations treat `TRUE` as `1` and `FALSE` as `0`:

```{r}
x <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)
```
.pull-left[
```{r}
sum(x)
mean(x)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
min(x)
max(x)
```
]

This can be handy when doing calculations that depend on conditions

---
name: conditionals

# Conditional transformations

`if_else()` can be used to do things based on a binary condition

```{r}
flights |> filter(dest == "MIA") |> 
    select(carrier, flight, dest, sched_dep_time) |> 
    mutate(too_early = if_else(sched_dep_time < 800, "too early!", "okay")) #<<
```

---

# Conditional transformations

`case_when()` is a more flexible approach that allows many different conditions

.pull-left[
```{r eval=FALSE}
flights |> 
  filter(dest == "MIA") |> 
  select(carrier, flight, sched_dep_time) |> 
  mutate(too_early = case_when( #<<
    sched_dep_time < 600   ~ "too early!", #<<
    sched_dep_time < 800   ~ "still early", #<<
    sched_dep_time <= 2000 ~ "okay", #<<
    sched_dep_time > 2000  ~ "late" #<<
    ) #<<
  ) #<<
```
Conditions are evaluated in order
]

.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE}
flights |> 
  filter(dest == "MIA") |> 
  select(carrier, flight, sched_dep_time) |> 
  mutate(too_early = case_when( #<<
    sched_dep_time < 600   ~ "too early!", #<<
    sched_dep_time < 800   ~ "still early", #<<
    sched_dep_time <= 2000 ~ "okay", #<<
    sched_dep_time > 2000  ~ "late" #<<
    ) #<<
  ) #<<
```
]

`condition ~ output` syntax is new; watch out for overlapping conditions!
