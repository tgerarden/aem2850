# Course evaluations

I take feedback seriously and will use it to improve this course!

Extra useful since this is the first offering of AEM 2850

Concrete suggestions are most helpful

**I would appreciate your feedback through two channels:**

1. Reflection - Week 15 - Course Feedback Survey
2. University course evaluations

Both will be anonymous

# University course evaluations

Anonymous: we just get summary reports, after grades are submitted

I will give you time to complete them in class next Tuesday

**I will award a bonus point on Reflection 15 for completing evaluations**

Thank you in advance for your feedback!

# Raw data is not enough!

This semester we developed tools and practices for:
  - Data cleaning
  - Data visualizing
  - Data analysis

--

Many of the lessons we learned are independent of software choice!

I hope they help you when working in Excel, python, R, Tableau, etc.

# What makes a great visualization?

Truthful

Functional

Beautiful

Insightful

Enlightening

Alberto Cairo, *The Truthful Art*

???

Alberto Cairo, *The Truthful Art*:

> 1. It is truthful, as it’s based on thorough and honest research.
> 
> 2. It is functional, as it constitutes an accurate depiction of the data, and it’s built in a way that lets people do meaningful operations based on it (seeing change in time).
> 
> 3. It is beautiful, in the sense of being attractive, intriguing, and even aesthetically pleasing for its intended audience—scientists, in the first place, but the general public, too.
> 
> 4. It is insightful, as it reveals evidence that we would have a hard time seeing otherwise.
> 
> 5. It is enlightening because if we grasp and accept the evidence it depicts, it will change our minds for the better.

# What makes a great visualization?

> "Graphical excellence is the **well-designed presentation of interesting data**—a matter of substance, of statistics, and of design … [It] consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision, and efficiency. … [It] is that which **gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space** … [It] is nearly always multivariate … And graphical excellence requires **telling the truth about the data**."

Edward Tufte, *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*, p. 51

Good aesthetics

No substantive issues

No perceptual issues

Honesty + good judgment
