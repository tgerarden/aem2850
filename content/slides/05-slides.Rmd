# Strings in R

Strings are also referred to as "characters" (abbreviated `chr`)

Strings can be stored in many ways:
- Vectors
- **Data frame columns**
- Elements in a list

So far we have used them as we would any other data

--

**But now we'll learn to filter on, modify, or analyze "functions" of strings**

---

# The stringr package

`stringr` is loaded as part of the core tidyverse

All `stringr` functions have intuitive names that start with `str_`

We will cover a bunch of handy functions this week:
1. `str_length`
2. `str_to_upper` and `str_to_lower`
3. `str_c` and `str_glue`
4. `str_detect`
5. `str_count`
6. `str_replace`

See `vignette("stringr")` for more

---

# We'll use data from The Office

The `schrute` package contains transcripts of all episodes of [The Office](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/) (US)

```{r}
library(schrute)
theoffice # this data frame is an object from the schrute package
```


---

# 1) str_length()

--

`str_length` tells you the number of characters in a string

--

```{r}
str_length("supercalifragilisticexpialidocious")
```

--
```{r}
theoffice |> 
  distinct(character) |> 
  slice_head(n = 5) |> 
  mutate(name_length = str_length(character)) #<<
```

---

# 2) str_to_lower() and str_to_upper()

`str_to_lower` converts to lower case

```{r}
str_to_lower("I went to Cornell, you ever heard of it?")
```

--

`str_to_upper` converts to upper case

```{r}
str_to_upper("I went to Cornell, you ever heard of it?")
```

--

Similar functionality for `str_to_title()` and `str_to_sentence()`

--

These functions are locale dependent (e.g., "en_GB" vs "en_US")


---

# 3) str_c()

--

We have seen `c` combine arguments to make a **longer** vector or list:

.pull-left-3[
```{r}
abc <- c("a", "b", "c")
c(abc, "s")
```
]

.pull-middle-3[
```{r, strip.white=FALSE}

c(abc, abc)
```
]

.pull-right-3[
```{r, strip.white=FALSE}

c(abc, NA)
```
]

--

By contrast, `str_c` combines arguments to make a **wider** character vector:

```{css, echo=FALSE}
/* Fix alignment of second set of columns */
.pull-right-3 ~ * { clear: unset; }
.pull-right-3 + * { clear: both; }
```

.pull-left-3[
```{r}
str_c(abc, "s")
```
]

.pull-middle-3[
```{r}
str_c(abc, abc)
```
]

.pull-right-3[
```{r}
str_c(abc, NA)
```
]

--

We can use `str_c` within data frames to combine strings at scale


---

# 3) str_c()

Here's an example of multiple columns in a data frame being combined into one:

```{r}
theoffice |> slice_head(n = 1) |> 
  select(character, text)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
theoffice |> slice_head(n = 1) |> 
    mutate(line = str_c(character, " said: ", text), .keep = "none") # mutate and keep only `line` #<<
```

--

```{r, echo=FALSE}
theoffice |> slice_head(n = 1) |> 
    mutate(line = str_c(character, " said: ", text), .keep = "none") # mutate and keep only `line` #<<
```

---

# 3) str_c()

`str_c` will automatically recycle fixed arguments like `" said: "` that are shorter than `character` and `text`:

```{r}
theoffice |> slice_head(n = 3) |> 
    mutate(line = str_c(character, " said: ", text), .keep = "none")
```

---

# 3) str_glue()

`str_glue()` provides similar functionality, but different syntax:

```{r}
theoffice |> slice_head(n = 3) |> 
  mutate(line = str_glue("{character} said: {text}"), .keep = "none") # note the different syntax #<<
```

Items inside `{}` are evaluated as if they are outside the quotes

This can be handy when combining many fixed and variable strings

--

`str_c()` and `str_glue()` work well with `mutate()` because their output is the same length as their inputs

# Regular expressions

---

# Regular expressions

What are regular expressions?

--

A concise, powerful way for describing patterns within strings

--

Regular expressions are a generic tool, not something specific to R

--

Let's use the names of some characters from The Office as examples:

```{r}
names <- theoffice |> distinct(character) |> slice_head(n = 10) |> pull(character)
names
```

---

# Pattern basics

The simplest patterns consist of literal characters

--

```{r}
names
```

`str_view` is a handy classroom utility for class to see how patterns match:

```{r}
str_view(names, pattern = "J")
```


---

# Pattern basics

Literal pattern matches are case-sensitive by default

--

```{r}
names
```

.pull-left[
What do you think this will return?
```{r, eval=FALSE}
str_view(names, pattern = "M")
```
]

.pull-right[
What do you think this will return?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
str_view(names, pattern = "m")
```
]

--

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
str_view(names, pattern = "M")
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
str_view(names, pattern = "m")
```
]

--

Note that these matches depend on **patterns**, not position


---

# Meta-characters

Punctuation characters like `.`, `+`, `*`, `[`, `]`, and `?` are **meta-characters** with special meanings

The most common one is `.`, which will match any character

--

What do you think these statements will return?

.pull-left[
```{r, eval=FALSE}
str_view(names, pattern = "J.m")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, eval=FALSE}
str_view(names, pattern = "J.n")
```
]

--

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
str_view(names, pattern = "J.m")
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
str_view(names, pattern = "J.n")
```
]

---

# Meta-characters

What do you think these statements will return?

.pull-left[
```{r, eval=FALSE}
str_view(names, pattern = "J..")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, eval=FALSE}
str_view(names, pattern = "J...")
```
]

--

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
str_view(names, pattern = "J..")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
str_view(names, pattern = "J...")
```
]

---

# Quantifiers

Quantifiers control how many times a pattern can match:

- `?` makes a pattern optional -- it matches 0 or 1 times
- `+` lets a pattern repeat -- it matches at least once
- `*` lets a pattern be optional or repeat

--

What do you think this statement will return?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
str_view(names, "M.*l") # match strings with M, then any number of any characters, then l
```

--

```{r, echo=FALSE}
str_view(names, "M.*l") # match strings with M, then any number of any characters, then l
```

--

Note that quantifiers modify the pattern they follow: we used `.*`, not `*.`

---

# Character classes

.pull-left[
`[]` lets you match a set of characters

```{r}
str_view(names, "[aeiou]") # vowels
```
]

--

.pull-right[
`^` inverts character class matches

```{r}
str_view(names, "[^aeiou]") # NOT vowels
```
]

---

# Alternation

Last one! Hang in there!

--

Alternation, `|`, allows you to search for one or more alternative patterns

This should seem familiar...

--

What do you think these statements will return?

.pull-left[
```{r, eval=FALSE}
str_view(names, "J.m|P.m")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, eval=FALSE}
str_view(names, "S.*|O.*")
```
]

--

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
str_view(names, "J.m|P.m")
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
str_view(names, "S.*|O.*")
```
]


---

# More patterns

See [Chapter 15 of R4DS (2e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/regexps.html#pattern-details) for more on:
- **escaping**: matching meta-characters as if they were literal strings
- **anchors**: match the start or end of a strong
- **character classes**: (continued)
- **quantifiers** (continued)
- **operator precedence**: parentheses, etc.
- **grouping**: back references, etc.

# 4) str_detect()

--

`str_detect` can be used to match patterns and return a logical vector

--

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
first_4_characters <- theoffice |> 
  distinct(character) |> 
  slice_head(n = 4) |> 
  pull(character)
```

```{r}
first_4_characters
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
str_detect(first_4_characters, "Dwight")
```
]

--

What do you think these statements will return?

.pull-left[
```{r, eval=FALSE}
str_detect(first_4_characters, "a")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, eval=FALSE}
str_detect(first_4_characters, "[aeiou]")
```
]

--

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
str_detect(first_4_characters, "a")
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
str_detect(first_4_characters, "[aeiou]")
```
]

--

How could we fit this into our current workflow?

---

# 4) str_detect()

`str_detect` is a powerful way to `filter` a data frame

--

```{r}
theoffice |> select(season, episode, character, text) |> 
  filter(str_detect(text,    # where to match a pattern: the column named "text" #<<
                    "sale")) # what pattern to match: the pattern "sale" #<<
```

---

# 4) str_detect()

Literal pattern matches with `str_detect` are case-sensitive

```{r}
theoffice |> select(season, episode, character, text) |> 
  filter(str_detect(text, 
                    "Sale")) # sale and Sale produce different output #<<
```

---

# 4) str_detect()

You could use multiple calls to `str_detect`, or use alternation:

```{r}
theoffice |> select(season, episode, character, text) |> 
  filter(str_detect(text, 
                    "sale|Sale")) # look for sale OR Sale #<<
```

---

# 4) str_detect()

You could consolidate this: regex parentheses are like in math

```{r}
theoffice |> select(season, episode, character, text) |> 
  filter(str_detect(text, 
                    "(s|S)ale")) # look for sale OR Sale #<<
```

---

# 4) str_detect()

Or use `regex` to ignore all cases and control other pattern matching details

```{r highlight.output = c(1)}
theoffice |> select(season, episode, character, text) |> 
  filter(str_detect(text, 
                    regex("sale", ignore_case = TRUE))) # ignore all cases #<<
```


---

# 4) str_detect()

When I say ignore all cases, I mean IGNORE ALL CASES!

```{r}
theoffice |> select(season, episode, character, text) |> 
  filter(str_detect(text, 
                    regex("sale", ignore_case = TRUE))) |>
  filter(!str_detect(text, "(s|S)ale")) # find non-standard form(s) #<<
```

---

# 4) str_detect()

`str_detect` can be combined with familiar functions to summarize data

--

```{r}
theoffice |> 
  filter(str_detect(text, regex("sale", ignore_case = TRUE))) |> 
  count(character, sort = TRUE) #<<
```

---

# 4) str_detect()

`str_detect` can be combined with familiar functions to summarize data

```{r}
theoffice |> 
  filter(str_detect(text, 
                    regex("that's what she said", ignore_case = TRUE))) |> #<<
  count(character, sort = TRUE)
```

---

# 4) str_detect()

`str_detect` with regular expressions can be very powerful

```{r highlight.output = c(5,6)}
theoffice |> select(character, text) |> 
  filter(str_detect(text, "assistant.*manager")) |> #<<
  slice_head(n = 10)
```

---

# 5) str_count()

`str_count` can be used to count the number of matches in a string

--

```{r}
theoffice |> 
  distinct(character) |> 
  slice_head(n = 5) |> 
  mutate(
    name = str_to_lower(character), # another way to avoid case sensitivity
    m_s = str_count(name, "m"), #<<
    i_s = str_count(name, "i") #<<
  )
```

---

# 5) str_count() with regex

```{r}
theoffice |> 
  distinct(character) |> 
  slice_head(n = 5) |> 
  mutate(
    name = str_to_lower(character),
    vowels = str_count(name, "[aeiou]"), # count matches of ANY of these characters #<<
    consonants = str_count(name, "[^aeiou]") # count matches of everything EXCEPT these characters #<<
  )
```

Reminder: `[]` lets you match a set of characters; `^` inverts character class matches

---

# 6) str_replace()

As the name suggests, `str_replace` can be used to modify patterns in strings

--

```{r}
names
str_replace(names, "Dw", "Duhw") # jim's office pronunciation guide
```

---

# 6) str_replace()

`str_replace` replaces the first match of a pattern

```{r}
str_replace("Phyllis", "l", "!")
```

`str_replace_all` replaces all matches of a pattern

```{r}
str_replace_all("Phyllis", "l", "!")
```

These pair naturally with `mutate` just like `str_c`, `str_glue`, and `str_count`
