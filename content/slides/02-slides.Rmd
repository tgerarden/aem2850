# Generative AI policy


---

# Generative AI policy

Generative AI (GAI) tools are very powerful assistants for widely used programming languages like R

You may use GAI tools in this course (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, etc.)

However, be aware of the limitations of GAI tools:
  - GAI tools can be misleading
  - GAI tools often proposed code that does not function
  - GAI code can be difficult to debug if you do not understand the fundamentals

---

# Generative AI example

Does anyone know where this quote is from?

> A-B-C. A-always, B-be, C-closing. Always be closing! Always be closing!!
> 
> A-I-D-A. Attention, interest, decision, action. Attention -- do I have your attention? Interest -- are you interested? I know you are because it's fuck or walk. You close or you hit the bricks! Decision -- have you made your decision for Christ?!! And action.
> 
> A-I-D-A; get out there!! You got the prospects comin' in; you think they came in to get out of the rain? Guy doesn't walk on the lot unless he wants to buy. Sitting out there waiting to give you their money! Are you gonna take it?

> nervous but excited

# Where we're from

```{r, prep-where_were_from, include = FALSE}
# LOAD PACKAGES (WILL UNLOAD BEFORE SHOWING HOW TIDYVERSE LOADS) ----

         country = `What country are you from?`,
         province = `Which province (or equivalent) are you from?`) |> 
  rbind(c(country = "United States of America", "virginia", NA))

# clean up for merging to us_states
plot_states <- where_were_from |>
  rename(region = state) |>
  group_by(region) |>
  summarize(count = n())

# clean up for merging to world

  mutate(
    region = case_when(
      country == "United States of America" ~ "usa",
      # use the following command to identify labels that need updating
      # anti_join(plot_countries, countries, by = "region")
      country == "American, Grew up in China" ~ "india", # arbitrarily taking first response
      country == "Indian" ~ "india",
      TRUE ~ stringr::str_to_lower(country)
    )
  ) |> 
  count(region)

# SUMMARIZE SHARE OF STUDENTS FROM NY ----
ny_share <- plot_states |> 
  mutate(
    total = sum(count),
    percent = round(count/total*100)
  ) |> 
  filter(region=="new york") |> 
  select(region, percent) |> 
  rename(origin = region)
```

How can we use your `r nrow(responses)` survey responses to construct our origin story without having to read them one by one?

--

- **Caveat:** This is based on submissions as of `r paste0(lubridate::hour(responses_timestamp), ":", lubridate::minute(responses_timestamp), " ", lubridate::wday(responses_timestamp, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE))`

--

We can use R for this!

--

I won't go through details now

<!-- I won't go through details now, but here is one way to approach it: -->

<!-- - use `readr` function `read_csv()` to import data from csv file -->
<!-- - use `dplyr` functions to manipulate data -->
<!-- - make maps using `ggplot2` -->

By the end of the course you should be able to do this kind of thing easily


---

# Are we all from New York?

What share of us are from the state of New York?

--

```{r}
# step 1: do a bunch of stuff that's omitted for clarity
# step 2: show us the answer!
ny_share
```

---

# Are we all from New York?


```{r us-map, echo = FALSE, fig.width=14, fig.height=7}
# MAKE MAP OF STATES ----

# R "dialects"

Last week we *briefly* introduced several R programming concepts:
  - logical expressions
  - assignment
  - object types
  - [object names, namespace conflicts]
  - [indexing]

We did this using base R
  - **pro:** comes in the box, close parallels to other programming languages
  - **con:** can be confusing for new programmers (esp. indexing operations)

---

# R "dialects"

.more-left[
This course will primarily use the tidyverse

You can think of it as a particular "dialect" of R

This dialect is similar to human language

Intuitive if you're new to programming

Not representative of all R programming

Base R and `data.table` are alternative "dialects"

# Tidyverse vs. base R

Lots of debate over tidyverse vs. base R

--

Why we're using the tidyverse:
- Consistent philosophy and syntax
- Great documentation and community support
- For data wrangling and plotting, tidyverse is ðŸ”¥

--

<br>

Base R is still great, can do some things tidyverse can't

**data.table** is another great alternative for data wrangling

---

# Tidyverse vs. base R

Often a correspondence between tidyverse and base R commands:

| tidyverse  |  base |
|---|---|
| `?readr::read_csv`  | `?utils::read.csv` |
|  `?dplyr::if_else` |  `?base::ifelse` |
|  `?tibble::tibble` |  `?base::data.frame` |

Tidyverse alternatives typically offer extra features

--

**Remember:** There are always multiple ways to do something in R

---

# Let's load the tidyverse meta-package

```{r, include = FALSE}
# UNLOAD PACKAGES TO ILLUSTRATE HOW TIDYVERSE LOADS ----
detach(package:ggplot2)
detach(package:dplyr)
detach(package:lubridate)
```

```{r tverse, cache = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

--

```{r tverse-output, cache = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

--

We just loaded a bunch of packages: **ggplot2**, **dplyr**, **tidyr**, **tibble**, etc.

We also see some **namespace conflicts**

---

# Tidyverse packages

When you install the tidyverse, you actually get a lot more packages:
```{r tverse_pkgs}
tidyverse_packages()
```

--

These other packages have to be loaded separately

---

# Tidyverse packages

Today we'll focus on [**dplyr**](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)

But first let's talk about data frames and pipes


---
name: tibbles

# Review: What are objects? 

There are many different *types* (or *classes*) of objects

Here are some objects that we'll be working with regularly:
- vectors
- matrices
- data frames
- lists
- functions


---

# Data frames

The most important object we'll work with is the **data frame**

You can think of it as an Excel spreadsheet

.pull-left[
```{r d}
# Create a small data frame called "d"
d <- data.frame(x = c("a", "b", "c"), y = 7:9)
d
```
]

.pull-right[

]

This is essentially just a table with columns named `x` and `y`

Each row is an observation telling us the values of both `x` and `y`

---

# Aside: tibbles are data frames with opinions

Tibbles are the default data frame in the tidyverse

Tibbles have some advantages, such as pretty printing

.pull-left[
```{r d2}
# Print the small data frame called "d"
d
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r d3, highlight.output = c(1, 3)}
# Convert d to a tibble for pretty printing
as_tibble(d)
```
]

**For this class, we'll treat "tibbles" and "data frames" as synonymous**

<!-- We will primarily use tibbles in this course -->

<!-- Two functions may come in handy: -->
<!-- - `as_tibble()` converts data frames to tibbles -->
<!-- - `tibble()` creates new tibbles from scratch -->

<!-- See `vignette("tibble")` for more -->

---

# Here is another example of a data frame

```{r tibble, highlight.output = c(1, 3, 14, 15)}
starwars # this data frame comes the tidyverse package dplyr
```

---
name: pipes

# Pipes

**Generic programming question:** Does anyone know what pipes do?

--

Pipes allow us to pass information through a sequence of operations

--

The tidyverse loads the `magrittr` pipe, denoted `%>%`

R now has a native pipe, denoted `|>` (since R version 4.1.0)

--

They are identical for simple cases, but have some differences

--

We will use `|>` in class

**Keyboard shortcut:** use `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+m` to insert the pipe (with spaces)
<!-- - You can [set the RStudio keyboard shortcut](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-pipes.html) to use either `%>%` or `|>` -->

---

# Pipe usage

To see why using pipes is so powerful, consider this contrived example based on what we did this morning:

1. Wake up
2. Get out of bed
4. Get dressed
5. Drink coffee
6. Go to class


---

# A day without pipes

You could code this through a series of assignment operations:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
me <- wake_up(me)
me <- get_out_of_bed(me)
me <- get_dressed(me)
me <- drink(me, "coffee")
me <- go(me, "class")
```

Or by putting all these operations in a single line of code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
me <- go(drink(get_dressed(get_out_of_bed(wake_up(me))), "coffee"), "class")
```

Neither is ideal

---

# Pipes are the best of both worlds

We can do everything at once, in order:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
me |> 
  wake_up() |> 
  get_out_of_bed() |> 
  get_dressed() |> 
  drink("coffee") |> 
  go("class")
```

Emphasis is on verbs (e.g., `wake_up`, `get_out_of_bed`, etc.), not nouns (i.e., `me`)

---

# Pipes: Best practices

Write linear code

Spread code out for readability: use one line per verb

Don't use pipes...
- when you need more than 10 (use intermediate objects instead)
- for multiple inputs or outputs
- for non-linear relationships

--

**Reminder:** `|>` and `%>%` can both be used, though they have some important differences for more advanced work. We will us `|>` in this class.

---
class: inverse, center, middle
name: dplyr

# dplyr

---

# What is dplyr?

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/02/dplyr_wrangling.png")
```

---

# What is dplyr?

The dplyr package provides a **grammar of data manipulation**

--

dplyr's functions are **verbs** that correspond to things we want to **do**

--

dplyr functions all have these things in common:
1. their first argument is a data frame
2. their other arguments describe what you want to do
3. their output is a new data frame

--

**1** + **3** + **pipes** allow us to combine simple steps to achieve complex results

---

# dplyr has five key verbs we will use

1. `select`: select columns (i.e., variables)

2. `filter`: subset rows based on their values

3. `arrange`: reorder rows based on their values

4. `mutate`: create new columns

5. `summarize`: collapse multiple rows into a single summary value


---

# dplyr verbs operate on different things

- Rows:
  - `filter`: subset rows based on their values
  - `arrange`: reorder rows based on their values
- Columns:
  - `select`: select columns (i.e., variables)
  - `mutate`: create new columns
- Groups of rows:
  - `summarize`: collapse multiple rows into a single summary value

--

Let's study these commands together using the `starwars` data frame that comes pre-packaged with dplyr

---
name: select

# 1) dplyr::select

Recall what the `starwars` data frame looks like:

```{r}
starwars
```


---

# 1) dplyr::select

`select` allows us to select columns / variables:

```{r select0, highlight.output = 1}
starwars |> select(name)
```

---

# 1) dplyr::select

You can get fancy: use commas to select multiple columns, deselect a column using "-", and select consecutive columns using "first:last"
```{r select1}
starwars |> 
  select(name:skin_color, species, -height)
```

---

# 1) dplyr::select

You can also rename your selected variables at the same time:
```{r select2}
starwars |>
  select(alias = name, crib = homeworld)
```

---

# 1) dplyr::select

If you just want to rename columns without subsetting them, use `rename`:
```{r rename2}
starwars |>
  rename(alias = name, crib = homeworld)
```

---

# 1) dplyr::~~select~~ relocate

You can also use `relocate` to move important variables to the "front" of a data frame without subsetting:
```{r relocate4}
starwars |> 
  relocate(species, homeworld) |>
  head(5)
```

---
# 1) dplyr::~~select~~ relocate

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='65%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/02/dplyr_relocate.png")
```


---
class: inverse, center, middle
name: example

# Let's work through an example on Posit Cloud


---
name: filter

# 2) dplyr::filter

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/02/dplyr_filter.jpg")
```

---

# 2) dplyr::filter

`filter` allows us to focus on certain rows / observations

--

For example, you may only be interested in droids:

```{r filter0}
starwars |> 
  filter(species == "Droid") 
```

---

# 2) dplyr::filter

Or perhaps you want to subset the humans that are taller than I am:

```{r filter1, eval = FALSE}
starwars |> 
  select(name, height, species) |> 
  filter( 
    species == "Human", 
    height >= 194
    )
```

Can you name one? *Hint: there's only one*

--

```{r filter1b, echo = FALSE, highlight.output = c(4)}
starwars |> 
  select(name, height, species) |> 
  filter( 
    species == "Human", 
    height >= 194
    )
```

---

# 2) dplyr::filter

A useful `filter` use case is identifying/removing missing data using `is.na`:
```{r filter3}
starwars |> 
  filter(is.na(height))
```

---

# 2) dplyr::filter

How could you build on this to remove rows with missing data?

--

```{r filter4}
starwars |> 
  filter(!is.na(height)) # use ! for negation
```

---
name: arrange

# 3) dplyr::arrange

`arrange` sorts the data frame based on the variable(s) you supply:

```{r arrange1}
starwars |> 
  arrange(birth_year)
```

---

# 3) dplyr::arrange

We can also arrange items in descending order using `arrange(desc())`:
```{r arrange2}
starwars |> 
  arrange(desc(birth_year))
```

---
name: mutate

# 4) dplyr::mutate

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='55%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/02/dplyr_mutate.png")
```

---

# 4) dplyr::mutate

You can create new columns from scratch or by transforming existing columns:
```{r mutate0}
starwars |> 
  select(name, height) |>
  mutate(height_in_inches = height / 2.54)
```

---

# 4) dplyr::mutate

You can create new columns from scratch or by transforming existing columns:
```{r mutate1}
starwars |> 
  select(name, height) |>
  mutate(height_in_inches = height / 2.54) |>
  mutate(height_in_feet = height_in_inches / 12)
```

---


# 4) dplyr::mutate

`mutate` creates variables in order, so we can chain them together in a single call:
```{r mutate2}
starwars |> 
  select(name, height) |>
  mutate(height_in_inches = height / 2.54, # separate with a comma
         height_in_feet = height_in_inches / 12)
```

---

# 4) dplyr::mutate

Boolean, logical, and conditional operators all work well with `mutate`

For example:
```{r mutate3, eval = FALSE}
starwars |> 
  filter(name=="Luke Skywalker" | name=="Anakin Skywalker") |> 
  select(name, height) |>
  mutate(tall = height > 180)
```

How many rows do you think this will return? How many columns?

--

```{r mutate3b, echo = FALSE}
starwars |> 
  filter(name=="Luke Skywalker" | name=="Anakin Skywalker") |> 
  select(name, height) |>
  mutate(tall = height > 180)
```

---
name: summarize

# 5) dplyr::summarize

Often we want to get summary statistics or *collapse* our data

`summarize` provides an easy way to do this

--

**Example:** "What are the mininum, maximum, and average prices of `diamonds`?"
```{r summ0}
diamonds |> 
  summarize(
    min = min(price),      # calculate the min price
    max = max(price),      # calculate the max price
    average = mean(price)  # calculate the mean price
  )
```

---

# 5) dplyr::summarize

Including `na.rm = TRUE` keeps NAs from propagating to the end result:

.pull-left[
```{r summ2l}
# probably not what we want
starwars |> 
  summarize(mh = mean(height))
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r summ2r}
# better
starwars |> 
  summarize(mh = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE))
```
]

--

Is this a feature or a bug?

--

It depends on the context!

---

# Bonus: dplyr::group_by

`summarize` is particularly useful in combination with `group_by`:
```{r summ1}
starwars |> 
  group_by(species) |> # for each species
  summarize(mean_height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE)) # calculate the mean height
```

---

# Bonus: dplyr::ungroup

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='65%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/02/group_by_ungroup.png")
```

Groups are persistent (sort of), `ungroup` removes them

---
class: inverse, center, middle
name: goodies

# Let's work through an example on Posit Cloud

(the remaining slides contain other dplyr goodies for your reference)

---

# Other dplyr goodies: distinct

`distinct` to isolate unique observations:
```{r}
starwars |> distinct(species)
```


---

# Other dplyr goodies: count

`count` to get the number of observations:
.pull-left[
```{r}
starwars |> 
  count(species)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
starwars |> 
  group_by(species) |> summarize(num = n())
```
]

---

# Other dplyr goodies: window functions

[Window functions](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/window-functions.html) make it easy to get leads and lags, percentiles, cumulative sums, etc.
- These are often used in conjunction with grouped mutates
- See `vignette("window-functions")`

--

<br>

The final set of dplyr "goodies" worth mentioning are the family of join operations, but we'll come back to those later
