## Course overview

### Course description

This course provides business students with an introduction to the most important tools in R for programming and data visualization. Students will learn the basics of R syntax, data structures, data wrangling, and data visualization using the grammar of graphics.

After taking this course, students will have the tools to complete basic tasks in R and interface effectively with statisticians and data scientists in business settings. This course also provides a foundation for future coursework to implement more advanced statistical methods in R.

### Course outcomes
1.	Develop basic proficiency in R programming
2.	Understand data structures and manipulation
3.	Describe effective techniques for data visualization and communication
4.	Construct effective data visualizations
5.	Utilize course concepts and tools for business applications

### Prerequisites:
- There are none! This is an introductory programming course
- AEM 2010, AEM 2011, or equivalent (Spreadsheet Modeling) is helpful but not required

<!-- ## Class Notes -->
<!-- Enrollment preference given to Dyson students in the Business Analytics concentration. Non-Dyson students require permission of instructor. -->



<!-- ## Course objectives -->

<!-- **Data rarely speaks for itself.** On their own, the facts contained in raw data are difficult to understand, and in the absence of beauty and order, it is impossible to understand the truth that the data shows. -->

<!-- In this class, you'll learn how to use industry-standard graphic and data design techniques to create beautiful, understandable visualizations and uncover truth in data. -->

<!-- By the end of this course, you will become (1) literate in data and graphic design principles, and (2) an ethical data communicator, by producing beautiful, powerful, and clear visualizations of your own data. Specifically, you should: -->

<!-- - Understand the principles of data and graphic design -->
<!-- - Evaluate the credibility, ethics, and aesthetics of data visualizations -->
<!-- - Create well-designed data visualizations with appropriate tools -->
<!-- - Share data and graphics in open forums -->
<!-- - Be curious and confident in consuming and producing data visualizations -->

<!-- This class will expose you to [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)—one of the most popular, sought-after, and in-demand statistical programming languages. Armed with the foundation of R skills you'll learn in this class, you'll know enough to be able to find how to visualize and analyze any sort of data-based question in the future. -->


### Course materials

All of the readings and software used for this class are **free**.

#### Books, articles, and other materials

We will draw on multiple textbooks, all of which are available online (**for free!**). You also have the option to get print versions of these books if you are interested.

<!-- - Alberto Cairo, *The Truthful Art: Data, Charts, and Maps for Communication* (Berkeley, California: New Riders, 2016) -->

- [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund

- [*Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction*](http://socviz.co/) by Kieran Healy

- [*Fundamentals of Data Visualization*](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/) by Claus E. Wilke

<!-- Another popular book is [*Storytelling with Data*](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/books) by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic, but we will not draw heavily on it because it is not free. -->


<!-- There will occasionally be additional articles and videos to read and watch. When this happens, links to these other resources will be included on the content page for that session. -->

<!-- I also highly recommend subscribing to the [R Weekly newsletter](https://rweekly.org/). This email is sent every Monday and is full of helpful tutorials about how to do stuff with R. -->

#### R and RStudio

You will do all of your analysis with the open source (and free!) programming language [R](https://cran.r-project.org/). You will use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) as the main program to access R. **Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard**—R handles all the calculations produces the actual statistics and graphical output, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.

R is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. To make life easier, we'll start by using the free [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/) service, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This means you won't have to install anything on your computer to get started with R!

We will have a shared class workspace in Posit Cloud that will let you quickly copy templates for examples, exercises, and mini projects.

Posit Cloud is convenient, but it can be slow and it is not designed to be able to handle larger datasets or more complicated analysis and graphics. You also can't use your own custom fonts with Posit Cloud. So you'll want to install R, RStudio, and other R packages on your own computer and wean yourself off of Posit Cloud over the first few weeks of the semester.

<!-- You can [find instructions for installing R, RStudio, and all the tidyverse packages here.](/resource/install/) -->

#### Online help

Programming can be difficult. Little errors in your code can cause hours of headache, even if you've been coding for years.

Fortunately there are tons of online resources to help you with this. Two of the most important are:
1. [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/): a Q&A site with tons of answers to all sorts of programming questions
2. [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/): a forum specifically for RStudio and the `tidyverse` (that's you!)
<!-- 3. [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com): an AI-powered chatbot that can help debug code (among other things) -->

These tools, and others, are valuable resources that can help you learn and work. That said, they can also provide misleading or incorrect answers. I encourage you to use them as tools for debugging your code, not as replacements for you and your developing expertise.[^1]

Searching for help with R online can sometimes be tricky because the program name is, ya know, the letter R. Search engines are generally smart enough to figure out what you mean when you search for "r scatterplot", but if it does struggle, try searching for "rstats" instead (e.g., "rstats scatterplot"). Also, since most of your R work will deal with `tidyverse` packages like `ggplot2`, it's often easier to use those keywords instead of the letter "r" (e.g., "ggplot scatterplot"). 

Finally, there are some excellent tutorials on R available through [Posit Primers](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers).



### Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) policy

Generative AI (GenAI) tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, and GitHub Copilot are very powerful assistants for widely used programming languages like R.

You may use GenAI tools in this course unless explicitly forbidden for a specific assignment.

However, be aware of the limitations of GenAI tools:

- GenAI tools can be misleading
- GenAI tools often propose code that does not function
- GenAI code can be difficult to debug if you do not understand the fundamentals

I **strongly** encourage you to focus on learning essential syntax and then, later, consider using these tools as helpers (or not at all), rather than relying on them as replacements for your own knowledge and function.


## Success in this course

I *know* you can succeed in this class.

Learning R can be difficult at first—it's like learning a new language, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you'll be using like `ggplot2`—[made this wise observation](https://r-posts.com/advice-to-young-and-old-programmers-a-conversation-with-hadley-wickham/): 

> It's easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, "Oh it's me, I'm really stupid," or, "I'm not made out to program." But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It's just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don't blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.

Even experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors. If you're finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, email me and the TAs, etc. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
# https://twitter.com/allison_horst/status/1213275783675822080
knitr::include_graphics("images/horst_error_tweet.png", error = FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics("images/gator_error.jpg", error = FALSE)
```


## Course schedule

The [schedule page](/schedule/) provides an overview of the topics we will cover. *Note:* the schedule will inevitably change throughout the semester as we go.


## Office hours and email

#### Office hours

Please watch this video:

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/270014784" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen style="display: block; margin: 0 auto 1rem;"></iframe>

Office hours are set times dedicated to you. 
 <!-- (most professors call these "office hours"; I don't^[There's fairly widespread misunderstanding about what office hours actually are! [Many students often think that they are the times I *shouldn't* be disturbed](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Can-This-Man-Change-How-Elite/245714/), which is the exact opposite of what they're for!]) -->
This means that I or a TA will be in an office and/or on zoom neeting waiting for you to talk to us about whatever questions you have. This is the best and easiest way to find us and the best chance for discussing class material and concerns.

I highly encourage you to utilize Professor and TA office hours, especially if you have trouble with basic `R` programming. [Times and locations are listed at the top of the syllabus](#meeting-times-and-locations).

#### Email

You can also reach us by email. The best approach for generic, time-sensitive questions is to email all of us at the same time (and reply-all in follow-up emails). You can do that with one click [here](mailto:gerarden@cornell.edu,vs424@cornell.edu,xw427@cornell.edu).


Email is a blessing and a curse. Here are some tips to help us get the most out of our email exchanges:

<!-- - Always include `[AEM 2850]` in your subject line (brackets included). -->
- Use a short but informative subject line. For example: `AEM 2850 - Final Project Grading`
- Use your University-supplied email for University business. This helps me know who you are.
- Ask direct questions. If you’re asking multiple related questions in one email, use a bulleted list. If you have multiple questions that aren't related, use multiple emails.
- One topic, one email. If you have multiple questions that aren't related, I prefer multiple emails.
- Be concise.


## Assignments and grading

### Assignments

Your grade in this course will be based on completing the following assignments:

- **Homeworks** are weekly assignments that require you to practice programming.
  - Late homework submissions will be accepted, with a penalty of 1 point per day late.

- **Prelims** are intended to assess programming and data visualization proficiency. Prelims will be completed in class.
  - In-class prelims are mandatory. No make up exams will be offered due to time conflicts (including but not limited to personal travel).

- The **group project** is intended to synthesize and reinforce the individual skills you develop in class, and to provide examples of their application to business and life more generally.

- **Class participation** and regular attendance are expected due to the interactive nature of this course.
  - Completing in-class **examples** are an important part of class participation and learning. If you miss class, you are still expected to complete the in-class examples for any classes that you miss by the end of that week.
  - Excessive absences and failure to complete weekly in-class examples will impact your final grade. There is no penalty for the first three absences, but you are still expected to complete the in-class examples for any classes that you miss by the end of that week. Prelim attendance is mandatory.
  - Please do not notify the instructor that you will miss class unless you anticipate missing more than three classes.

**Note: Students in AEM 5850** will have to complete a few extra assignments and meet slightly different requirements for the project.

Please read [the assignments page](/assignment/) for more details on the assignments and their underlying rationale.

<!-- Each type of assignment will contribute to the final grade as follows: -->

```{r assignments-grades, include=FALSE}
assignments <- tribble(
  ~Points,  ~Assignment,
  # 14 * 5  , "Reflections (14 x 5 points each)",
  # 30 , "Homeworks (13 x 10 points each)",
  35      , "Homeworks",
  20      , "Prelim 1",
  20      , "Prelim 2",
  20      , "Group project",
  5       , "Class participation"
) %>%
  mutate(Percent = Points / sum(Points),
         Percent = scales::percent(Percent, accuracy = 1))
```

<div align="center">
```{r show-assignments-table, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
assignments_total <- tibble(Assignment = "Total",
                            Points = sum(assignments$Points),
                            Percent = "100%")

bind_rows(assignments, assignments_total) %>%
  dplyr::select(Assignment, Percent) %>% 
  kable(., align = "lrr")
```
</div>


### Regrade policy

Regrade requests must be received within one week of when a graded assignment is returned to students.

### Grading scale

<div align="center">

| Grade | Range     | Grade | Range  | Grade | Range |
|:-----:|:---------:|:-----:|:------:|:-----:|:-----:|
| A+    | :unicorn: | A     | 93-100 | A-    | 90-92 |
| B+    | 87-89     | B     | 83-86  | B-    | 80-82 |
| C+    | 77-79     | C     | 73-76  | C-    | 70-72 |
| D+    | 67-69     | D     | 63-66  | D-    | 60-62 |
| F     | <60       |       |        |       |       |

</div>


**Dyson grading policy:** Dyson faculty policy mandates that grades reflect a range of outcomes distinguishing between failing, poor, good, and excellent performance. The latter category is awarded an A grade and is considered the top mark in this course. The grade of A+ is awarded only for extraordinary achievement far above the mean and will in no case make up more than 5% of total final grades.

## University policies

### Academic integrity
Each student in this course is expected to abide by the Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity: https://cuinfo.cornell.edu/aic.cfm. Any work submitted by a student in this course for academic credit will be the student's own work. You are encouraged to study together and to discuss information and concepts covered in this course and the sections with other students. However, this permissible cooperation should never involve one student having possession of a copy of all or part of work done by someone else, in the form of an electronic or hard copy. This policy extends beyond peers in the course: buying, selling, or otherwise sharing course materials is prohibited. Should copying occur, both the student who copied work from another student and the student who gave material to be copied will both automatically receive a zero for the assignment/exam. Penalty for violation of this Code can also be extended to include failure of the course and University disciplinary action.

### Sharing of course materials is prohibited

Sharing of course materials is prohibited. These materials include, but are not limited to: in-class assignments, homework assignments, exams, and solutions. Accessing course materials through friends or indirectly online is a violation of the Code of Academic Integrity.
