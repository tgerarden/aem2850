<h2>Announcements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Office hours
<ul>
<li>TAs will hold office hours Wednesday, Feb 26 (see canvas)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Prelim 1
<ul>
<li>Will be similar in structure to homework assignments, though slightly more open-ended questions and less direct guidance</li>
<li>We will not provide scaffolded code</li>
<li>Prelim will be distributed on Posit Cloud at class start time</li>
<li>Complete and submit via canvas by class end time (penalties may apply)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Instructions:
<ul>
<li>You must complete Prelim 1 <strong>in person</strong> in our assigned classroom during class</li>
<li>Prelim 1 is open book and open internet, but <strong>do not communicate with classmates</strong></li>
<li>Do not use functions or other syntax that we have not explicitly covered in the course slides or in-class examples</li>
<li>Do not use packages outside the <code>tidyverse</code> packages we have already loaded for you</li>
<li>When done, <strong>upload BOTH your .qmd and .pdf files</strong> to <a href="">canvas</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Additional Notes:
<ul>
<li>The prelim is 100 points total, and each question states the number of points it is worth</li>
<li><strong>Render early and often</strong> to avoid wasting time sorting out what code needs debugging</li>
<li>We will give partial credit if your answers are incomplete, especially if you provide comments or text that describes the logic of what you <em>would</em> do if you had more time</li>
<li>If you have trouble rendering your document, do not delete your work in progress code. That will make it hard for us to give you partial credit. Instead, you can:
<ul>
<li>Comment out problematic code using <code>#</code> or keyboard shortcut Cntrl/Cmd-Shift-C</li>
<li>Replace <code>{r}</code> with <code>{r, eval = FALSE}</code> at the top of the relevant code chunk</li>
<li>Ask questions!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>GRADE PENALTIES AND/OR REFERRALS TO THE ACADEMIC INTEGRITY HEARING BOARD MAY APPLY</strong> if you fail to follow any instructions</li>
</ul>
