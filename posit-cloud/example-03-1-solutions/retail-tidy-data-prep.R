# the census publishes estimates of state-level Monthly State Retail Sales
# at https://www.census.gov/retail/state_retail_sales.html
# let's look at retail sales year-over-year percentage changes
# use read_csv to read in data from the url https://www.census.gov/retail/mrts/www/statedata/state_retail_yy.csv and assign it to retail

# use pivot_longer() to construct a data frame where the level of observation is
# the fips-stateabbr-naics-yearmonth, and the variable of interest is yoy_pct_change
# you'll need to convert yoy_pct_change from a character to a numberic
