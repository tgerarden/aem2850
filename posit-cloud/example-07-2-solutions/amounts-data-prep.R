# AEM 2850 - Example 7 part 2
# Plan for today:
# - Questions?
# - On our own devices: work through this script
#   - Write your own code in place of "______"
# - As a group: discuss results, answer questions


# 0. Loading packages and prepping data -----
# we need to install packages once before we can use them
# install.packages("tidyverse") # this has already been done for you
library(tidyverse) # load the core tidyverse packages

# use theme_set to get clean plots without having to specify the theme each time
theme_set(theme_minimal()) # set the current theme to theme_minimal()
# you can use theme_set(theme()) to return to defaults if you prefer

# today we'll explore beer statistics from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB)
# intermediate source: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-03-31/readme.md
# i have done a little pre-processing for your convenience


# 1. Brewers across the United States ----
# the first dataset we'll use summarizes total beer production by state in 2019

# prep data

  group_by(state, year) %>%
  summarize(million_barrels = sum(barrels)/1e6) %>%
  ungroup()
write_csv(beer_states, "beer_states.csv")



# 2. Brewers across the size distribution ----
# the second dataset we'll use summarizes the number of brewers and total beer production by year and brewer size category

# prep data
