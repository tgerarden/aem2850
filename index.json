Cheatsheets Click here to download the RStudio IDE cheatsheet\nClick here to download the Quarto cheatsheet\nGetting started with R and RStudio R is not a programming language like C or Java. It was not created by software engineers for software development. Instead, it was developed by statisticians as an interactive environment for data analysis. This interactivity makes it easy to explore data quickly, which is an indispensable feature for many tasks in business analytics, statistics, data science, and other fields.\nIf you have prior programming experience, you may be surprised by differences between R and other programming languages.\nIf you have no prior programming experience, you may initially be frustrated when learning R. That is normal! Learning to program is essentially learning to speak a new language. But in some ways it‚Äôs even more difficult, because your interlocutor is a computer who isn‚Äôt always great at telling you when you said something that made no sense.\nRegardless of your prior experience, if you are patient, you will come to appreciate the power of R for data analysis and data visualization.\nR, and the R console You can think of R analogously to the engine in a car: it will power our work. One way to control that engine is to use the R console to execute commands as you type them, or to run scripts you have already written. There are several ways to gain access to the R console. One way is to install R on your computer and open the built-in console, which looks like this:\n   However, most people don‚Äôt use this console. Instead, they use an integrated development environment (or IDE) to write, debug, and execute their code.\nRStudio The IDE we will use in this class is RStudio. RStudio includes an editor with many R-specific features, a console to execute your code, and other useful panes, including one to show figures or view html documents you produce. RStudio looks like this:\n   RStudio will be our launching pad for data science projects. You can think of it as the dashboard in your car. It not only provides an editor for us to create and edit our scripts but also provides many other useful tools. In this section, we go over some of the basics.\nRStudio panes When you start RStudio for the first time, you will see three panes by default. The left pane shows the R console. On the right, the top pane includes tabs such as Environment and History, while the bottom pane shows six tabs: File, Plots, Packages, Help, Viewer, and Presentation (these tabs may change in new versions). You can click on each tab to move across the different features.\nTo start a new R script, you can click on File, then New File, then R Script.\nThis starts a new pane on the left and it is here where you can start writing your script.\nKeyboard shortcuts Many tasks we perform with the mouse can be achieved with a combination of key strokes instead, or keyboard shortcuts For example, we just showed how to use the mouse to start a new script, but you can also use a shortcut: Ctrl+‚áß+N on Windows and ‚åò+‚áß+N on macs.\nAlthough using the mouse to explore RStudio‚Äôs dropdown menus is a good place to start, I highly recommend that you memorize key bindings for the operations you use most. RStudio provides a useful cheat sheet with the most widely used commands. If you‚Äôre on a mac, you can access a list of keyboard by pressing ‚å•+‚áß+K. You might want to keep this in mind so you can look up keyboard shortcuts when you find yourself doing the same point-and-click operations repeatedly.\nTab completion One advantage of using RStudio is that it has context-aware tab completion. This means that when you start typing the name of a package, function, or object you want to use, RStudio will automatically suggest ways to complete your input. You can take advantage of this by scrolling through the suggestions using up/down arrows and hitting tab to use ‚Ä¶","date":1756311175,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1756311175,"objectID":"8492f1a04989019e2f783414b45533e3","permalink":"https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/example/01-example/","publishdate":"2025-08-27T16:12:55Z","relpermalink":"/example/01-example/","section":"example","summary":"Introduction to Examples Examples contain material we will discuss and use to learn R in class.

You will use RStudio as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard‚ÄîR handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.\nPosit Cloud R is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. To make life easier, this course uses posit.cloud, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This means you won‚Äôt have to install anything on your computer to get started with R! We have a shared class workspace on Posit Cloud that will let you quickly copy templates for examples and homework assignments.\nGo to http://posit.cloud/ and create an account. You‚Äôll receive a link to join the shared class workspace separately. If you don‚Äôt get this link, let me know and I will invite you.\nRStudio on your computer Posit Cloud is convenient, but it can be slow and it is not designed to be able to handle larger datasets, more complicated analysis, or fancier graphics. Over the course of the semester, you might want to wean yourself off of Posit Cloud and install all these things locally. This will also be handy in the future if you want to use R for other classes, jobs, etc.\nHere are some links to get set up for this class:\nInstall R First you need to install R itself (the engine).\n  Go to the CRAN (Collective R Archive Network)1 website: https://cran.r-project.org/\n  Click on ‚ÄúDownload R for XXX‚Äù, where XXX is your operating system:\n  If you use macOS, scroll down to the first .pkg file in the list of files (in this picture, it‚Äôs R-4.1.2.pkg) and download it.\n  If you use Windows, click ‚Äúbase‚Äù (or click on the bolded ‚Äúinstall R for the first time‚Äù link) and download it.\n    Double click on the downloaded file (check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n  If you use macOS, download and install XQuartz.2 You do not need to do this on Windows.\n  Install RStudio Next, you need to install RStudio (the dashboard). Once both R and RStudio are installed, you can ignore R and only use RStudio. RStudio will use R automatically and you won‚Äôt have to interact with R directly.\n  Go to the free download location on RStudio‚Äôs website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\n  The website should automatically detect your operating system (macOS or Windows) and show a big download button for it. For example:\nIf not, scroll down a little to the large table and choose the version of RStudio that matches your operating system.\n  Double click on the downloaded file (again, check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n  Double click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).\nInstall tidyverse R packages are easy to install with RStudio. There are multiple ways to do it. Here are two ways to install the tidyverse and all its dependencies from CRAN:\n Within RStudio, enter install.packages(\u0026#34;tidyverse\u0026#34;) in the R console.  Select the packages panel, click on ‚ÄúInstall,‚Äù type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter.  You‚Äôll see a bunch of output in the RStudio console as all the tidyverse packages and dependencies are installed. If you choose option 2, you might notice that RStudio implements your selection by generating the line of code install.packages(\u0026#34;tidyverse\u0026#34;) and entering it in the console.\nYou can use either of these methods to install additional packages for your work. Packages just need to be installed once per device (and then loaded each time you want to use them).\nInstall rmarkdown Follow your preferred procedure from above to install rmarkdown.\nInstall tinytex Note: If you already have a LaTeX distribution installed on your device, you can skip this step.\nWhen you knit to PDF, R uses a special scientific typesetting program named LaTeX (pronounced ‚Äúlay-tek‚Äù; for goofy nerdy reasons, the x is technically the ‚Äúch‚Äù sound in ‚ÄúBach‚Äù, but most people just say it as ‚Äúk‚Äù).\nLaTeX is neat and makes pretty documents, but it‚Äôs a huge program‚Äîthe macOS version, for instance, is over 4 GB! To make life easier, there‚Äôs an R package named TinyTeX that installs a minimal LaTeX program and that automatically deals with differences between macOS and Windows.\nHere‚Äôs how to install tinytex so you can knit to pretty PDFs:\n Use the Packages in panel in RStudio to install tinytex like you did above with tidyverse. Alternatively, run install.packages(\u0026#34;tinytex\u0026#34;) in the console. Run tinytex::install_tinytex() in the console. Wait for a bit while R downloads and installs everything you need. The end! You should now be able to knit to PDF.  Reminder: come to office hours if you need help with this!

It‚Äôs fairly short and just has lots of examples of good and bad ways of writing code (naming variables, dealing with long lines, using proper indentation levels, etc.)‚Äîyou should glance through it some time.\nRStudio has a built-in way of cleaning up your code. Select some code, press ctrl + i (on Windows) or ‚åò + i (on macOS), and R will reformat the code for you. It‚Äôs not always perfect, but it‚Äôs really helpful for getting indentation right without having to manually hit space a billion times.\nMain style things to pay attention to for this class  Note: We won‚Äôt grade you on this! If you submit something like filter(mpg,cty\u0026gt;10,class==\u0026#34;compact\u0026#34;), we might recommend adding spaces, but we won‚Äôt take points off.\n Spacing  See the ‚ÄúSpacing‚Äù section in the tidyverse style guide.\n Put spaces after commas (like in regular English):\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) # Bad filter(mpg,cty \u0026gt; 10) filter(mpg ,cty \u0026gt; 10) filter(mpg , cty \u0026gt; 10)  Put spaces around operators like +, -, \u0026gt;, =, etc.:\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) # Bad filter(mpg, cty\u0026gt;10) filter(mpg, cty\u0026gt; 10) filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt;10)  Don‚Äôt put spaces around parentheses that are parts of functions:\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) # Bad filter (mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) filter ( mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) filter( mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10 )  Long lines  See the ‚ÄúLong lines‚Äù section in the tidyverse style guide.\n It‚Äôs good practice to make sure your lines of code don‚Äôt get too long. A good suggestion is to keep lines at a maximum of 80 characters. Instead of counting characters by hand (ü•¥), in RStudio go to ‚ÄúTools‚Äù \u0026gt; ‚ÄúGlobal Options‚Äù \u0026gt; ‚ÄúCode‚Äù \u0026gt; ‚ÄúDisplay‚Äù and check the box for ‚ÄúShow margin.‚Äù You should now see a really thin line indicating 80 characters. Again, you can go beyond this‚Äîthat‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs just good practice to avoid going too far past it.\nYou can add line breaks inside longer lines of code. Line breaks should come after commas, and things like function arguments should align within the function:\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026#34;compact\u0026#34;) # Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026#34;compact\u0026#34;) # Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026#34;compact\u0026#34;) # Bad filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class %in% c(\u0026#34;compact\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pickup\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;midsize\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;subcompact\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;suv\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;2seater\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;minivan\u0026#34;)) # Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class %in% c(\u0026#34;compact\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pickup\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;midsize\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;subcompact\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;suv\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;2seater\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;minivan\u0026#34;))  Pipes (%\u0026gt;%) and ggplot layers (+) Put each step in a dplyr pipeline on separate lines, with the %\u0026gt;% at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:\n# Good mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Bad mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Super bad mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Super bad and won\u0026#39;t even work mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))  Put each layer of a ggplot plot on separate lines, with the + at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:\n# Good ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() # Bad ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() # Super bad ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() # Super bad and won\u0026#39;t even work ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw()  Comments  See the ‚ÄúComments‚Äù section in the tidyverse style guide.\n Comments should start with a comment symbol and a single space: # \n# Good #Bad #Bad  If the comment is really short (and won‚Äôt cause you to go over 80 characters in the line), you can include it in the same line as the code:\nmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% # Only rows where cty is 10 + group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% # Divide into class groups summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Find the average hwy in each group  You can add extra spaces to get inline comments to align, if you want:\nmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% # Only rows where cty is 10 + group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% # Divide into class groups summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Find the average hwy in each group  If the comment is really long, you can break it into multiple lines.
