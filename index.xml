&lt;li>Questions? 🙋‍♀️&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As a group: briefly skim through &lt;code>basic-base-r-intro.R&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Then spend class working through &lt;code>basic-base-r-practice.R&lt;/code>:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We will explore data from &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this FiveThirtyEight article&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In breakout rooms: 1. Getting Comfortable with Data Frames&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As a group: discuss results, answer questions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In breakout rooms: 2. Using Functions in Packages&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="installing-r-packages">Installing R packages&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The functionality provided by a fresh install of R is only a small fraction of what is possible. In fact, we refer to what you get after your first install as &lt;em>base R&lt;/em>. To access additional functionality, we can use add-ons made by developers. There are currently hundreds of these available from CRAN and many others shared via other repositories such as GitHub. However, because not everybody needs all available functionality, R instead makes different components available via &lt;em>packages&lt;/em>. R makes it very easy to install packages from within R. For example, to install the &lt;strong>tidyverse&lt;/strong> package, which we will use throughout the semester, you would just type:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r">install.packages(&amp;quot;tidyverse&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>In RStudio, you can also do this by navigating to the &lt;em>Tools&lt;/em> tab and selecting install packages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After installation is complete, we can then load the package into our current R session using the &lt;code>library&lt;/code> function:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r">library(tidyverse)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>You only need to install a package once if you are working with a local installation of R. On RStudio Cloud, you may sometimes need to install packages within multiple projects, but I will usually do this for you in advance. After that, you can load it using &lt;code>library&lt;/code> whenever you need it. The package remains loaded until we quit the R session (or &lt;code>detach&lt;/code> it).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note that installing &lt;strong>tidyverse&lt;/strong> actually installs several packages. This commonly occurs when a package has &lt;em>dependencies&lt;/em>, or uses functions from other packages. When you load a package using &lt;code>library&lt;/code>, you also load its dependencies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can see all the packages you have installed using the &lt;em>Packages&lt;/em> tab in RStudio or via the following function:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r">installed.packages()
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>As we move through this course, we will learn more about packages and keep adding them to our toolbox.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- **Note that in this course (at least, on most browsers), grey boxes are used to show R code typed into the R console. The symbol `##` is used to denote what the R console outputs.** --></description></item><item><title>Week 2</title><link>https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/assignment/02-lab/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Feb 2022 21:48:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/assignment/02-lab/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="reflection">Reflection&lt;/h2>

&lt;h2 id="getting-started">Getting started with R and RStudio&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>R is not a programming language like &lt;code>C&lt;/code> or &lt;code>Java&lt;/code>. It was not created by software engineers for software development. Instead, it was developed by statisticians as an interactive environment for data analysis. This interactivity makes it easy to explore data quickly, which is an indispensable feature for many tasks in business analytics, statistics, data science, and other fields.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have prior programming experience, you may be surprised by differences between R and other programming languages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have no prior programming experience, you may initially be frustrated when learning R. That is normal! Learning to program is essentially learning to speak a new language. But in some ways it&amp;rsquo;s even more difficult, because your interlocutor is a computer who isn&amp;rsquo;t always great at telling you when you said something that made no sense.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Regardless of your prior experience, if you are patient, you will come to appreciate the power of R for data analysis and data visualization.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- However, like in other programming languages, you can save your work as scripts that can be easily executed at any moment. These scripts serve as a record of the analysis you performed, a key feature that facilitates reproducible work. -->
&lt;h2 id="r-and-the-r-console">R, and the R console&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As we already discussed, R is the engine that will power our work. One way to control that engine is to use the &lt;em>R console&lt;/em> to execute commands as you type them, or to run scripts you have already written. There are several ways to gain access to the R console. One way is to install R on your computer and open the built-in console, which looks like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/example/images/01/Rconsole.png" alt="Rconsole" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, most people don&amp;rsquo;t use this console. Instead, they use an &lt;em>integrated development environment&lt;/em> (or IDE) to write, debug, and execute their code.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="rstudio">RStudio&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The IDE we will use in this class is RStudio. RStudio includes an editor with many R-specific features, a console to execute your code, and other useful panes, including one to show figures or view html documents you produce. RStudio looks like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/example/images/01/rstudio.png" alt="rstudio" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>RStudio will be our launching pad for data science projects. It not only provides an editor for us to create and edit our scripts but also provides many other useful tools. In this section, we go over some of the basics.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="rstudio-panes">RStudio panes&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When you start RStudio for the first time, you will see three panes by default. The left pane shows the R console. On the right, the top pane includes tabs such as &lt;em>Environment&lt;/em> and &lt;em>History&lt;/em>, while the bottom pane shows five tabs: &lt;em>File&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Plots&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Packages&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Help&lt;/em>, and &lt;em>Viewer&lt;/em> (these tabs may change in new versions). You can click on each tab to move across the different features.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To start a new R script, you can click on File, then New File, then R Script.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This starts a new pane on the left and it is here where you can start writing your script.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="keyboard-shortcuts">Keyboard shortcuts&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Many tasks we perform with the mouse can be achieved with a combination of key strokes instead, or keyboard shortcuts For example, we just showed how to use the mouse to start a new script, but you can also use a shortcut: Ctrl+⇧+N on Windows and ⌘+⇧+N on macs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although using the mouse to explore RStudio&amp;rsquo;s dropdown menus is a good place to start, &lt;strong>I highly recommend that you memorize key bindings for the operations you use most&lt;/strong>. RStudio provides a useful cheat sheet with the most widely used commands. If you&amp;rsquo;re on a mac, you can access a list of keyboard by pressing ⌥+⇧+K. You might want to keep this in mind so you can look up keyboard shortcuts when you find yourself doing the same point-and-click operations repeatedly.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="tab-completion">Tab completion&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>One advantage of using RStudio is that it has context-aware tab completion. This means that when you start typing the name of a package, function, or object you want to use, RStudio will automatically suggest ways to complete your input. You can take advantage of this by scrolling through the suggestions using up/down arrows and hitting tab to use the selected completion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>RStudio also does handy things like adding a close parentheses when you type an open parentheses, such as if you type &lt;code>library(&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="running-commands-while-editing-scripts">Running commands while editing scripts&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There are many editors specifically made for coding. These are useful because color and indentation are automatically added to make code more readable. RStudio is one of these editors, and it was specifically developed for R. One of the main advantages provided by RStudio over other editors is that we can test our code easily as we edit our scripts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can see this by opening a new script. Give the script a name. You can do this through the editor by saving the current new unnamed script. To do this, click on the save icon or use the key binding Ctrl+S on Windows and ⌘+S on the Mac.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you ask for the document to be saved for the first time, RStudio will prompt you for a name. A good convention is to use a descriptive name, with lower case letters, no spaces, only hyphens to separate words, and then followed by the suffix &lt;em>.R&lt;/em>. Call your script &lt;em>my-first-script.R&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now we are ready to start editing our first script. For example, you could write:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r">print(&amp;quot;welcome to RStudio&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>If you do this and hit ↩ in the editor, nothing will happen in the console.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To &lt;em>execute&lt;/em> your new script, you can click on the &lt;em>Run&lt;/em> button on the upper right side of the editing pane or use the keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+⇧+↩ on Windows or ⌘+⇧+↩ on Mac. When you do this, the console will show the command as well as its output:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>## [1] &amp;quot;welcome to RStudio&amp;quot;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>To run one line at a time instead of the entire script, you can use Ctrl+↩ on Windows and ⌘+↩ on Mac.&lt;/p>

&lt;!-- **SETUP TIP** -->
&lt;!-- Change the option _Save workspace to .RData on exit_ to _Never_ and uncheck the _Restore .RData into workspace at start_. By default, when you exit R saves all the objects you have created into a file called .RData. This is done so that when you restart the session in the same folder, it will load these objects. I find that this causes confusion especially when sharing code with colleagues or peers. -->
&lt;!-- ::: -->
&lt;h2 id="r-markdown">R Markdown&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>R Markdown provides a unified authoring framework for data science, combining your code, its results, and your prose commentary. R Markdown documents are fully reproducible and support dozens of output formats, like PDFs, Word files, slideshows, and more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>R Markdown files are designed to be used in three ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>For communicating to decision makers, who want to focus on the conclusions, not the code behind the analysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>For collaborating with others (including future you!) who are interested in your conclusion &lt;em>and&lt;/em> how you reached them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>As an environment in which to &lt;em>do&lt;/em> business analytics, where you can capture not only what you did, but also what you were thinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>All three of these are relevant for this course. Hopefully you can see how the first could be useful in business settings where you need to present a summary of ideas or findings to a decision maker.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>RStudio includes two links to Cheatsheets that are a great resource as you begin to work with R Markdown:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>R Markdown Cheat Sheet: &lt;em>Help &amp;gt; Cheatsheets &amp;gt; R Markdown Cheat Sheet&lt;/em>,&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>R Markdown Reference Guide: &lt;em>Help &amp;gt; Cheatsheets &amp;gt; R Markdown Reference Guide&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>See &lt;a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com&lt;/a> for a more detailed summary of R Markdown&amp;rsquo;s functionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="r-markdown-basics">R Markdown basics&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>R Markdown files contain three types of content:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>An (optional) &lt;strong>YAML header&lt;/strong> surrounded by &lt;code>---&lt;/code>s.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Chunks&lt;/strong> of R code surrounded by &lt;code>```&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Text mixed with simple text formatting like &lt;code># heading&lt;/code> and &lt;code>_italics_&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>You can edit each of these to affect the final output.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you are done composing your document, you can &lt;strong>knit&lt;/strong> it by clicking Knit or by using the keyboard shorcut ⌘+⇧+K. This will process the file through several steps to produce your output in the format you specify.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="markdown-basics">Markdown basics&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Markdown is a set of formatting conventions for plain text files that is widely used (beyond R). We will use an example file on RStudio Cloud to learn about some basic text formatting using Markdown. You can also read more about this in &lt;a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html#text-formatting-with-markdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">R for Data Science&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- **Note that in this course (at least, on most browsers), grey boxes are used to show R code typed into the R console. The symbol `##` is used to denote what the R console outputs.** --></description></item><item><title>Installing R, RStudio, tidyverse, and tinytex</title><link>https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/resource/install/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/resource/install/</guid><description>&lt;p>You will do all of your work in this class with the open source (and free!) programming language &lt;a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">R&lt;/a>. You will use &lt;a href="https://www.rstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RStudio&lt;/a> as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard—R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="rstudiocloud">RStudio.cloud&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>R is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. To make life easier, you can (and should!) use the free &lt;a href="http://rstudio.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RStudio.cloud&lt;/a> service &lt;em>initially&lt;/em>, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This means you won&amp;rsquo;t have to install anything on your computer to get started with R! We will have a shared class workspace in RStudio.cloud that will let you quickly copy templates for labs and problem sets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Go to &lt;a href="https://rstudio.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://rstudio.cloud/&lt;/a> and create an account. You&amp;rsquo;ll receive a link to join the shared class workspace separately. If you don&amp;rsquo;t get this link, let me know and I will invite you.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="rstudio-on-your-computer">RStudio on your computer&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>RStudio.cloud is convenient, but it can be slow and it is not designed to be able to handle larger datasets, more complicated analysis, or fancier graphics. Over the course of the semester, you should wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud and install all these things locally. This is also important if you want to customize fonts, since RStudio.cloud has extremely limited support for fonts other than Helvetica.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s how you install all these things&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="install-r">Install R&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>First you need to install R itself (the engine).&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Go to the CRAN (Collective R Archive Network)&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> website: &lt;a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://cran.r-project.org/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Click on &amp;ldquo;Download R for &lt;code>XXX&lt;/code>&amp;rdquo;, where &lt;code>XXX&lt;/code> is either Mac or Windows:&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/img/install/install-r-links.png" width="60%" />
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If you use macOS, scroll down to the first &lt;code>.pkg&lt;/code> file in the list of files (in this picture, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>R-4.0.0.pkg&lt;/code>; as of right now, the current version is also 4.0.0) and download it.&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/img/install/install-r-mac.png" width="100%" />
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If you use Windows, click &amp;ldquo;base&amp;rdquo; (or click on the bolded &amp;ldquo;install R for the first time&amp;rdquo; link) and download it.&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/img/install/install-r-windows.png" width="100%" />
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Double click on the downloaded file (check your &lt;code>Downloads&lt;/code> folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If you use macOS, &lt;a href="https://www.xquartz.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download and install XQuartz&lt;/a>. You do not need to do this on Windows.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="install-rstudio">Install RStudio&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Next, you need to install RStudio, the nicer graphical user interface (GUI) for R (the dashboard). Once R and RStudio are both installed, you can ignore R and only use RStudio. RStudio will use R automatically and you won&amp;rsquo;t ever have to interact with it directly.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Go to the free download location on RStudio&amp;rsquo;s website: &lt;a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The website should automatically detect your operating system (macOS or Windows) and show a big download button for it:&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/img/install/install-r-rstudio1.png" width="50%" />
&lt;p>If not, scroll down a little to the large table and choose the version of RStudio that matches your operating system.&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/img/install/install-r-rstudio2.png" width="100%" />
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Double click on the downloaded file (again, check your &lt;code>Downloads&lt;/code> folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Double click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="install-tidyverse">Install &lt;code>tidyverse&lt;/code>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>R packages are easy to install with RStudio. Select the packages panel, click on &amp;ldquo;Install,&amp;rdquo; type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter.&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/img/install/install-r-package-panel.png" width="40%" />
&lt;p>This can sometimes be tedious when you&amp;rsquo;re installing lots of packages, though. &lt;a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The tidyverse&lt;/a>, for instance, consists of dozens of packages (including &lt;strong>ggplot2&lt;/strong>) that all work together. Rather than install each individually, you can install a single magical package and get them all at the same time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Go to the packages panel in RStudio, click on &amp;ldquo;Install,&amp;rdquo; type &amp;ldquo;tidyverse&amp;rdquo;, and press enter. You&amp;rsquo;ll see a bunch of output in the RStudio console as all the tidyverse packages are installed.&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/img/install/install-r-tidyverse.png" width="60%" />
&lt;p>Notice also that RStudio will generate a line of code for you and run it: &lt;code>install.packages(&amp;quot;tidyverse&amp;quot;)&lt;/code>. You can also just paste and run this instead of using the packages panel.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="install-tinytex">Install &lt;code>tinytex&lt;/code>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When you knit to PDF, R uses a special scientific typesetting program named LaTeX (pronounced &amp;ldquo;lay-tek&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;lah-tex&amp;rdquo;; for goofy nerdy reasons, the x is technically the &amp;ldquo;ch&amp;rdquo; sound in &amp;ldquo;Bach&amp;rdquo;, but most people just say it as &amp;ldquo;k&amp;rdquo;—saying &amp;ldquo;layteks&amp;rdquo; is frowned on for whatever reason).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>LaTeX is neat and makes pretty documents, but it&amp;rsquo;s a huge program—&lt;a href="https://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the macOS version, for instance, is nearly 4 GB&lt;/a>! To make life easier, there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://yihui.org/tinytex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an R package named &lt;strong>tinytex&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> that installs a minimal LaTeX program and that automatically deals with differences between macOS and Windows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s how to install &lt;strong>tinytex&lt;/strong> so you can knit to pretty PDFs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Use the Packages in panel in RStudio to install &lt;strong>tinytex&lt;/strong> like you did above with &lt;strong>tidyverse&lt;/strong>. Alternatively, run &lt;code>install.packages(&amp;quot;tinytex&amp;quot;)&lt;/code> in the console.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run &lt;code>tinytex::install_tinytex()&lt;/code> in the console.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wait for a bit while R downloads and installs everything you need.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The end! You should now be able to knit to PDF.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

You can do everything you can with &lt;a href="https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/reference/markdown/">regular Markdown&lt;/a>, but you can incorporate graphs, tables, and other R output directly in your document. You can create HTML, PDF, and Word documents, PowerPoint and HTML presentations, websites, books, and even &lt;a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interactive dashboards&lt;/a> with R Markdown. This whole course website is created with R Markdown (and &lt;a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a package named &lt;strong>blogdown&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documentation for R Markdown&lt;/a> is extremely comprehensive, and their &lt;a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tutorials&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-15.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cheatsheets&lt;/a> are excellent—rely on those.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are the most important things you&amp;rsquo;ll need to know about R Markdown in this class:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="key-terms">Key terms&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Document&lt;/strong>: A Markdown file where you type stuff&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Chunk&lt;/strong>: A piece of R code that is included in your document. It looks like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-markdown">```{r}
# Code goes here
```
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>There must be an empty line before and after the chunk. The final three backticks must be the only thing on the line—if you add more text, or if you forget to add the backticks, or accidentally delete the backticks, your document will not knit correctly.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Knit&lt;/strong>: When you &amp;ldquo;knit&amp;rdquo; a document, R runs each of the chunks sequentially and converts the output of each chunk into Markdown. R then runs the knitted document through &lt;a href="https://pandoc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pandoc&lt;/a> to convert it to HTML or PDF or Word (or whatever output you&amp;rsquo;ve selected).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can knit by clicking on the &amp;ldquo;Knit&amp;rdquo; button at the top of the editor window, or by pressing &lt;code>⌘⇧K&lt;/code> on macOS or &lt;code>control + shift + K&lt;/code> on Windows.&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/img/assignments/knit-button.png" width="30%" />
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="add-chunks">Add chunks&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are three ways to insert chunks:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Press &lt;code>⌘⌥I&lt;/code> on macOS or &lt;code>control + alt + I&lt;/code> on Windows&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Click on the &amp;ldquo;Insert&amp;rdquo; button at the top of the editor window&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/img/reference/insert-chunk.png" width="30%" />
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Manually type all the backticks and curly braces (don&amp;rsquo;t do this)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="chunk-names">Chunk names&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can add names to chunks to make it easier to navigate your document. If you click on the little dropdown menu at the bottom of your editor in RStudio, you can see a table of contents that shows all the headings and chunks. If you name chunks, they&amp;rsquo;ll appear in the list. If you don&amp;rsquo;t include a name, the chunk will still show up, but you won&amp;rsquo;t know what it does.&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/img/reference/chunk-toc.png" width="40%" />
&lt;p>To add a name, include it immediately after the &lt;code>{r&lt;/code> in the first line of the chunk. Names cannot contain spaces, but they can contain underscores and dashes. &lt;strong>All chunk names in your document must be unique.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-markdown">```{r name-of-this-chunk}
# Code goes here
```
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="chunk-options">Chunk options&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are a bunch of different options you can set for each chunk. You can see a complete list in the &lt;a href="https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RMarkdown Reference Guide&lt;/a> or at &lt;a href="https://yihui.org/knitr/options/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;strong>knitr&lt;/strong>&amp;rsquo;s website&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Options go inside the &lt;code>{r}&lt;/code> section of the chunk:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-markdown">```{r name-of-this-chunk, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Code goes here
```
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The most common chunk options are these:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>fig.width=5&lt;/code> and &lt;code>fig.height=3&lt;/code> (&lt;em>or whatever number you want&lt;/em>): Set the dimensions for figures&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>echo=FALSE&lt;/code>: The code is not shown in the final document, but the results are&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>message=FALSE&lt;/code>: Any messages that R generates (like all the notes that appear after you load a package) are omitted&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>warning=FALSE&lt;/code>: Any warnings that R generates are omitted&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>include=FALSE&lt;/code>: The chunk still runs, but the code and results are not included in the final document&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>You can also set chunk options by clicking on the little gear icon in the top right corner of any chunk:&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/img/reference/chunk-options.png" width="70%" />
&lt;h2 id="inline-chunks">Inline chunks&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can also include R output directly in your text, which is really helpful if you want to report numbers from your analysis. To do this, use &lt;code>`r r_code_here`&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s generally easiest to calculate numbers in a regular chunk beforehand and then use an inline chunk to display the value in your text. For instance, this document…&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-markdown">```{r find-avg-mpg, echo=FALSE}
avg_mpg &amp;lt;- mean(mtcars$mpg)
```
The average fuel efficiency for cars from 1974 was `r round(avg_mpg, 1)` miles per gallon.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>… would knit into this:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The average fuel efficiency for cars from 1974 was 20.1 miles per gallon.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="output-formats">Output formats&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can specify what kind of document you create when you knit in the &lt;a href="https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/reference/markdown/#front-matter">YAML front matter&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-yaml">title: &amp;quot;My document&amp;quot;
output:
html_document: default
pdf_document: default
word_document: default
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>You can also click on the down arrow on the &amp;ldquo;Knit&amp;rdquo; button to choose the output &lt;em>and&lt;/em> generate the appropriate YAML. If you click on the gear icon next to the &amp;ldquo;Knit&amp;rdquo; button and choose &amp;ldquo;Output options&amp;rdquo;, you change settings for each specific output type, like default figure dimensions or whether or not a table of contents is included.&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/img/reference/output-options.png" width="35%" />
&lt;p>The first output type listed under &lt;code>output:&lt;/code> will be what is generated when you click on the &amp;ldquo;Knit&amp;rdquo; button or press the keyboard shortcut (&lt;code>⌘⇧K&lt;/code> on macOS; &lt;code>control + shift + K&lt;/code> on Windows). If you choose a different output with the &amp;ldquo;Knit&amp;rdquo; button menu, that output will be moved to the top of the &lt;code>output&lt;/code> section.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The indentation of the YAML section matters, especially when you have settings nested under each output type. Here&amp;rsquo;s what a typical &lt;code>output&lt;/code> section might look like:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-yaml">---

&lt;p>I highly recommend subscribing to the &lt;a href="https://rweekly.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">R Weekly newsletter&lt;/a>. This e-mail is sent every Monday and is full of helpful tutorials about how to do stuff with R.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Searching for help with R on Google can sometimes be tricky because the program name is a single letter. Google is generally smart enough to figure out what you mean when you search for &amp;ldquo;r scatterplot&amp;rdquo;, but if it does struggle, try searching for &amp;ldquo;rstats&amp;rdquo; instead (e.g. &amp;ldquo;rstats scatterplot&amp;rdquo;). Also, since most of your R work in this class will deal with &lt;strong>ggplot2&lt;/strong>, it&amp;rsquo;s often easier to just search for that instead of the letter &amp;ldquo;r&amp;rdquo; (e.g. &amp;ldquo;ggplot scatterplot&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you use Twitter, post R-related questions and content with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#rstats&lt;/a>. The community there is exceptionally generous and helpful. Also check out &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StackOverflow&lt;/a> (a Q&amp;amp;A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions) and &lt;a href="https://community.rstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RStudio Community&lt;/a> (a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (i.e. you)).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These resources are also really really helpful:&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="r-in-the-wild">R in the wild&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A popular (and increasingly standard) way for sharing your analyses and visualizations is to post an annotated explanation of your process somewhere online. RStudio allows you to publish knitted HTML files directly to &lt;a href="http://rpubs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPubs&lt;/a>, but you can also post your output to a blog or other type of website.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> Reading these kinds of posts is one of the best ways to learn R, since they walk you through each step of the process &lt;em>and&lt;/em> show the code and output.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>R is fairly forgiving about how you type code (unlike other languages like Python, where miscounting spaces can ruin your code!). All of these things will do exactly the same thing:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r">mpg %&amp;gt;%
filter(cty &amp;gt; 10, class == &amp;quot;compact&amp;quot;)
mpg %&amp;gt;% filter(cty &amp;gt; 10, class == &amp;quot;compact&amp;quot;)
mpg %&amp;gt;%
filter(cty &amp;gt; 10,
class == &amp;quot;compact&amp;quot;)
mpg %&amp;gt;% filter(cty&amp;gt;10, class==&amp;quot;compact&amp;quot;)
filter(mpg,cty&amp;gt;10,class==&amp;quot;compact&amp;quot;)
mpg %&amp;gt;%
filter(cty &amp;gt; 10,
class == &amp;quot;compact&amp;quot;)
filter ( mpg,cty&amp;gt;10, class==&amp;quot;compact&amp;quot; )
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>But you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that only a few of those iterations (the first three) are easily readable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To help improve readability and make it easier to share code with others, there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an unofficial style guide for writing R code&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s fairly short and just has lots of examples of good and bad ways of writing code (naming variables, dealing with long lines, using proper indentation levels, etc.)—you should glance through it some time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>RStudio has a built-in way of cleaning up your code. Select some code, press &lt;kbd>ctrl&lt;/kbd> + &lt;kbd>i&lt;/kbd> (on Windows) or &lt;kbd>⌘&lt;/kbd> + &lt;kbd>i&lt;/kbd> (on macOS), and R will reformat the code for you. It&amp;rsquo;s not always perfect, but it&amp;rsquo;s really helpful for getting indentation right without having to manually hit &lt;kbd>space&lt;/kbd> a billion times.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Important note&lt;/em>: I won&amp;rsquo;t ever grade you on any of this! If you submit something like &lt;code>filter(mpg,cty&amp;gt;10,class==&amp;quot;compact&amp;quot;)&lt;/code>, I might recommend adding spaces, but it won&amp;rsquo;t affect your grade or points or anything.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="spacing">Spacing&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>See the &lt;a href="https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#spacing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&amp;ldquo;Spacing&amp;rdquo; section&lt;/a> in the tidyverse style guide.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Put spaces after commas (like in regular English):&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r"># Good
filter(mpg, cty &amp;gt; 10)
# Bad
filter(mpg , cty &amp;gt; 10)
filter(mpg ,cty &amp;gt; 10)
filter(mpg,cty &amp;gt; 10)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Put spaces around operators like &lt;code>+&lt;/code>, &lt;code>-&lt;/code>, &lt;code>&amp;gt;&lt;/code>, &lt;code>=&lt;/code>, etc.:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r"># Good
filter(mpg, cty &amp;gt; 10)
# Bad
filter(mpg, cty&amp;gt;10)
filter(mpg, cty&amp;gt; 10)
filter(mpg, cty &amp;gt;10)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t put spaces around parentheses that are parts of functions:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r"># Good
filter(mpg, cty &amp;gt; 10)
# Bad
filter (mpg, cty &amp;gt; 10)
filter ( mpg, cty &amp;gt; 10)
filter( mpg, cty &amp;gt; 10 )
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h3 id="long-lines">Long lines&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>See the &lt;a href="https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#long-lines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&amp;ldquo;Long lines&amp;rdquo; section&lt;/a> in the tidyverse style guide.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s generally good practice to not have really long lines of code. A good suggestion is to keep lines at a maximum of 80 characters. Instead of counting characters by hand (ew), in RStudio go to &amp;ldquo;Tools&amp;rdquo; &amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Global Options&amp;rdquo; &amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Code&amp;rdquo; &amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Display&amp;rdquo; and check the box for &amp;ldquo;Show margin&amp;rdquo;. You should now see a really thin line indicating 80 characters. Again, you can go beyond this—that&amp;rsquo;s fine. It&amp;rsquo;s just good practice to avoid going too far past it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can add line breaks inside longer lines of code. Line breaks should come after commas, and things like function arguments should align within the function:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r"># Good
filter(mpg, cty &amp;gt; 10, class == &amp;quot;compact&amp;quot;)
# Good
filter(mpg, cty &amp;gt; 10,
class == &amp;quot;compact&amp;quot;)
# Good
filter(mpg,
cty &amp;gt; 10,
class == &amp;quot;compact&amp;quot;)
# Bad
filter(mpg, cty &amp;gt; 10, class %in% c(&amp;quot;compact&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;pickup&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;midsize&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;subcompact&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;suv&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;2seater&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;minivan&amp;quot;))
# Good
filter(mpg,
cty &amp;gt; 10,
class %in% c(&amp;quot;compact&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;pickup&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;midsize&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;subcompact&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;suv&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;2seater&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;minivan&amp;quot;))
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h3 id="pipes--and-ggplot-layers-">Pipes (&lt;code>%&amp;gt;%&lt;/code>) and ggplot layers (&lt;code>+&lt;/code>)&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Put each layer of a ggplot plot on separate lines, with the &lt;code>+&lt;/code> at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r"># Good
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) +
geom_point() +
geom_smooth() +
theme_bw()
# Bad
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) +
geom_point() + geom_smooth() +
theme_bw()
# Super bad
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw()
# Super bad and won't even work
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class))
+ geom_point()
+ geom_smooth()
+ theme_bw()
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Put each step in a dplyr pipeline on separate lines, with the &lt;code>%&amp;gt;%&lt;/code> at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r"># Good
mpg %&amp;gt;%
filter(cty &amp;gt; 10) %&amp;gt;%

summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))
# Super bad
mpg %&amp;gt;% filter(cty &amp;gt; 10) %&amp;gt;% group_by(class) %&amp;gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))
# Super bad and won't even work
mpg %&amp;gt;%
filter(cty &amp;gt; 10)
%&amp;gt;% group_by(class)
%&amp;gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h3 id="comments">Comments&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>See the &lt;a href="https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#comments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&amp;ldquo;Comments&amp;rdquo; section&lt;/a> in the tidyverse style guide.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Comments should start with a comment symbol and a single space: &lt;code># &lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r"># Good
#Bad
#Bad
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>If the comment is really short (and won&amp;rsquo;t cause you to go over 80 characters in the line), you can include it in the same line as the code, separated by at least two spaces (it works with one space, but using a couple can enhance readability):&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r">mpg %&amp;gt;%
filter(cty &amp;gt; 10) %&amp;gt;% # Only rows where cty is 10 +
group_by(class) %&amp;gt;% # Divide into class groups
summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Find the average hwy in each group
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>You can add extra spaces to get inline comments to align, if you want:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r">mpg %&amp;gt;%
filter(cty &amp;gt; 10) %&amp;gt;% # Only rows where cty is 10 +
group_by(class) %&amp;gt;% # Divide into class groups
summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Find the average hwy in each group
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>If the comment is really long, you can break it into multiple lines. RStudio can do this for you if you go to &amp;ldquo;Code&amp;rdquo; &amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Reflow comment&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r"># Good

&lt;p>Though, if you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with comments that are &lt;em>that&lt;/em> long, consider putting the text in R Markdown instead and having it be actual prose.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unzipping files</title><link>https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/resource/unzipping/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/resource/unzipping/</guid><description>&lt;p>Because RStudio projects typically consist of multiple files (R scripts, datasets, graphical output, etc.) the easiest way to distribute them to you for examples, assignments, and projects is to combine all the different files in to a single compressed collection called a &lt;strong>zip file&lt;/strong>. When you unzip a zipped file, your operating system extracts all the files that are contained inside into a new folder on your computer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unzipping files on macOS is trivial, but unzipping files on Windows can mess you up if you don&amp;rsquo;t pay careful attention. Here&amp;rsquo;s a helpful guide to unzipping files on both macOS and Windows.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="unzipping-files-on-macos">Unzipping files on macOS&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Double click on the downloaded &lt;code>.zip&lt;/code> file. macOS will automatically create a new folder with the same name as the &lt;code>.zip&lt;/code> file, and all the file&amp;rsquo;s contents will be inside. Double click on the RStudio Project file (&lt;code>.Rproj&lt;/code>) to get started.&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/img/unzipping/unzip-mac.png" width="60%" />
&lt;h2 id="unzipping-files-on-windows">Unzipping files on Windows&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>tl;dr&lt;/strong>: Right click on the &lt;code>.zip&lt;/code> file, select &amp;ldquo;Extract All…&amp;rdquo;, and work with the resulting unzipped folder.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unlike macOS, Windows does &lt;em>not&lt;/em> automatically unzip things for you. If you double click on the &lt;code>.zip&lt;/code> file, Windows will show you what&amp;rsquo;s inside, but it will do so without actually extracting anything. This &lt;del>can be&lt;/del> is incredibly confusing! Here&amp;rsquo;s what it looks like—the only clues that this folder is really a &lt;code>.zip&lt;/code> file are that there&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;Compressed Folder Tools&amp;rdquo; tab at the top, and there&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;Ratio&amp;rdquo; column that shows how much each file is compressed.&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/img/unzipping/inside-zip-windows.png" width="80%" />
&lt;p>It is very tempting to try to open files from this view. However, if you do, things will break and you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to correctly work with any of the files in the zipped folder. If you open the R Project file, for instance, RStudio will point to a bizarre working directory buried deep in some temporary folder:&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/img/unzipping/temp-wd-windows.png" width="60%" />
&lt;p>You most likely won&amp;rsquo;t be able to open any data files or save anything, which will be frustrating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead, you need to right click on the &lt;code>.zip&lt;/code> file and select &amp;ldquo;Extract All…&amp;quot;:&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/img/unzipping/extract-windows-1.png" width="60%" />

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;strong>Data is Plural newsletter&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>: Jeremy Singer-Vine sends a weekly newsletter of the most interesting public datasets he&amp;rsquo;s found.

&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Political science and economics datasets&lt;/strong>: There&amp;rsquo;s a wealth of data available for political science- and economics-related topics:&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="math">Math&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Markdown uses LaTeX to create fancy mathematical equations. There are like a billion little options and features available for math equations—you can find &lt;a href="http://www.malinc.se/math/latex/basiccodeen.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helpful examples of the the most common basic commands here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can use math in two different ways: inline or in a display block. To use math inline, wrap it in single dollar signs, like &lt;code>\$y = mx + b\$&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;colgroup>
&lt;col width="52%" />
&lt;col width="47%" />
&lt;/colgroup>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr class="header">
&lt;th>Type…&lt;/th>
&lt;th>…to get&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr class="odd">
&lt;td>&lt;pre>Based on the DAG, the regression model for
estimating the effect of education on wages
is &amp;dollar;\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \epsilon&amp;dollar;, or
&amp;dollar;\text{Wages} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Education} + \epsilon&amp;dollar;.&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Based on the DAG, the regression model for
estimating the effect of education on wages
is &lt;span class="math inline">\(\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \epsilon\)&lt;/span>, or
&lt;span class="math inline">\(\text{Wages} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Education} + \epsilon\)&lt;/span>.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>To put an equation on its own line in a display block, wrap it in double dollar signs, like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Type…&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-text">The quadratic equation was an important part of high school math:
$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$
But now we just use computers to solve for $x$.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>…to get…&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The quadratic equation was an important part of high school math:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But now we just use computers to solve for &lt;code>\(x\)&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Because dollar signs are used to indicate math equations, you can&amp;rsquo;t just use dollar signs like normal if you&amp;rsquo;re writing about actual dollars. For instance, if you write &lt;code>This book costs \$5.75 and this other costs \$40&lt;/code>, Markdown will treat everything that comes between the dollar signs as math, like so: &amp;ldquo;This book costs $5.75 and this other costs $40&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get around that, put a backslash (&lt;code>\&lt;/code>) in front of the dollar signs, so that &lt;code>This book costs \\\$5.75 and this other costs \\\$40&lt;/code> becomes &amp;ldquo;This book costs &lt;span>$5.75&lt;/span> and this other costs &lt;span>$40&lt;/span>&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tables">Tables&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are 4 different ways to hand-create tables in Markdown—I say &amp;ldquo;hand-create&amp;rdquo; because it&amp;rsquo;s normally way easier to use R to generate these things with packages like &lt;a href="https://rapporter.github.io/pander/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;strong>pander&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> (use &lt;code>pandoc.table()&lt;/code>) or &lt;strong>knitr&lt;/strong> (use &lt;a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/kable.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;code>kable()&lt;/code>&lt;/a>). The two most common are simple tables and pipe tables. &lt;a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#tables" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You should look at the full documentation here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>For simple tables, type…&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Table: Caption goes here&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are two different ways to add footnotes (&lt;a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#footnotes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see here for complete documentation&lt;/a>): regular and inline.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Regular notes need (1) an identifier and (2) the actual note. The identifier can be whatever you want. Some people like to use numbers like &lt;code>[^1]&lt;/code>, but if you ever rearrange paragraphs or add notes before #1, the numbering will be wrong (in your Markdown file, not in the output; everything will be correct in the output). Because of that, I prefer to use some sort of text label:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Type…&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-text">Here is a footnote reference[^1] and here is another [^note-on-dags].
[^1]: This is a note.
[^note-on-dags]: DAGs are neat.
And here's more of the document.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>…to get…&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Here is a footnote reference&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1">&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup>&lt;/a> and here is another.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2">&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And here&amp;rsquo;s more of the document.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr />
&lt;div class="footnotes">
&lt;ol>
&lt;li id="fn1">&lt;p>This is a note.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn2">&lt;p>DAGs are neat.&lt;a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩︎&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>You can also use inline footnotes with &lt;code>^[Text of the note goes here]&lt;/code>, which are often easier because you don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about identifiers:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Type…&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-text">Causal inference is neat.^[But it can be hard too!]
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>…to get…&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Causal inference is neat.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3">&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;hr />
&lt;div class="footnotes">
&lt;ol>
&lt;li id="fn3">&lt;p>But it can be hard too!&lt;a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩︎&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="front-matter">Front matter&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can include a special section at the top of a Markdown document that contains metadata (or data about your document) like the title, date, author, etc. This section uses a special simple syntax named &lt;a href="https://learn.getgrav.org/16/advanced/yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YAML&lt;/a> (or &amp;ldquo;YAML Ain&amp;rsquo;t Markup Language&amp;rdquo;) that follows this basic outline: &lt;code>setting: value for setting&lt;/code>. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example YAML metadata section. Note that it must start and end with three dashes (&lt;code>---&lt;/code>).&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-yaml">---
title: Title of your document
date: &amp;quot;January 13, 2020&amp;quot;
author: &amp;quot;Your name&amp;quot;
---
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>You can put the values inside quotes (like the date and name in the example above), or you can leave them outside of quotes (like the title in the example above). I typically use quotes just to be safe—if the value you&amp;rsquo;re using has a colon (&lt;code>:&lt;/code>) in it, it&amp;rsquo;ll confuse Markdown since it&amp;rsquo;ll be something like &lt;code>title: My cool title: a subtitle&lt;/code>, which has two colons. It&amp;rsquo;s better to do this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-yaml">---
title: &amp;quot;My cool title: a subtitle&amp;quot;
---
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>If you want to use quotes inside one of the values (e.g. your document is &lt;code>An evaluation of &amp;quot;scare quotes&amp;quot;&lt;/code>), you can use single quotes instead:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-yaml">---
title: 'An evaluation of &amp;quot;scare quotes&amp;quot;'
---
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="citations">Citations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of the most powerful features of Markdown + pandoc is the ability to automatically cite things and generate bibliographies. to use citations, you need to create a &lt;a href="http://www.bibtex.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BibTeX file&lt;/a> (ends in &lt;code>.bib&lt;/code>) that contains a database of the things you want to cite. You can do this with bibliography managers designed to work with BibTeX directly (like &lt;a href="https://bibdesk.sourceforge.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BibDesk&lt;/a> on macOS), or you can use &lt;a href="https://www.zotero.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zotero&lt;/a> (macOS and Windows) to export a &lt;code>.bib&lt;/code> file. You can &lt;a href="https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/resource/citations/">download an example &lt;code>.bib&lt;/code> file of all the readings from this class here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Complete details for using citations can be found here&lt;/a>. In brief, you need to do three things:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Add a &lt;code>bibliography:&lt;/code> entry to the YAML metadata:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-yaml">---
title: Title of your document
date: &amp;quot;January 13, 2020&amp;quot;
author: &amp;quot;Your name&amp;quot;
bibliography: name_of_file.bib
---
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Choose a citation style based on a CSL file. The default is Chicago author-date, but you can choose from 2,000+ &lt;a href="https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at this repository&lt;/a>. Download the CSL file, put it in your project folder, and add an entry to the YAML metadata (or provide a URL to the online version):&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-yaml">---
title: Title of your document
date: &amp;quot;January 13, 2020&amp;quot;
author: &amp;quot;Your name&amp;quot;
bibliography: name_of_file.bib
csl: &amp;quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/apa.csl&amp;quot;
---
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Some of the most common CSLs are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/chicago-author-date.csl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chicago author-date&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/chicago-note-bibliography.csl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chicago note-bibliography&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/chicago-fullnote-bibliography.csl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chicago full note-bibliography&lt;/a> (no shortened notes or ibids)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/apa.csl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">APA 7th edition&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/modern-language-association.csl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MLA 8th edition&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Cite things in your document. &lt;a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Check the documentation for full details of how to do this&lt;/a>. Essentially, you use &lt;code>@citationkey&lt;/code> inside square brackets (&lt;code>[]&lt;/code>):&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Type…&lt;/th>
&lt;th>…to get…&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;code>Causal inference is neat [@Rohrer:2018; @AngristPischke:2015].&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Causal inference is neat (Rohrer 2018; Angrist and Pischke 2015).&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;code>Causal inference is neat [see @Rohrer:2018, p. 34; also @AngristPischke:2015, chapter 1].&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Causal inference is neat (see Rohrer 2018, 34; also Angrist and Pischke 2015, chap. 1).&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>

&lt;td>Angrist and Pischke say causal inference is neat (2015; see also Rohrer 2018).&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;code>@AngristPischke:2015 [chapter 1] say causal inference is neat, and @Rohrer:2018 agrees.&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Angrist and Pischke (2015, chap. 1) say causal inference is neat, and Rohrer (2018) agrees.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>After compiling, you should have a perfectly formatted bibliography added to the end of your document too:&lt;/p>
