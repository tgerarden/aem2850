&lt;h2 id="tidyverse-version">tidyverse version&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong> If you are working locally, make sure you are running at least &lt;strong>dplyr&lt;/strong> 1.0.0:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r"># packageVersion('dplyr')
# install.packages('dplyr') # install updated version if &amp;lt; 1.0.0
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="installing-r-packages">Installing R packages&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The functionality provided by a fresh install of R is only a small fraction of what is possible. In fact, we refer to what you get after your first install as &lt;em>base R&lt;/em>. To access additional functionality, we can use add-ons made by developers. There are currently hundreds of these available from CRAN and many others shared via other repositories such as GitHub. However, because not everybody needs all available functionality, R instead makes different components available via &lt;em>packages&lt;/em>. R makes it very easy to install packages from within R. For example, to install the &lt;strong>tidyverse&lt;/strong> package, which we will use throughout the semester, you would just type:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r">install.packages(&amp;quot;tidyverse&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>In RStudio, you can also do this by navigating to the &lt;em>Packages&lt;/em> pane or via the &lt;em>Tools&lt;/em> menu &amp;gt; Install Packages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After installation is complete, we can then load the package into our current R session using the &lt;code>library&lt;/code> function:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r">library(tidyverse)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>You only need to install a package once if you are working with a local installation of R. On RStudio Cloud, you may sometimes need to install packages within multiple projects, but I will usually do this for you in advance. After that, you can load it using &lt;code>library&lt;/code> whenever you need it. The package remains loaded until we quit the R session (or &lt;code>detach&lt;/code> it).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note that installing &lt;strong>tidyverse&lt;/strong> actually installs several packages. This commonly occurs when a package has &lt;em>dependencies&lt;/em>, or uses functions from other packages. When you load a package using &lt;code>library&lt;/code>, you also load its dependencies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can see all the packages you have installed using the &lt;em>Packages&lt;/em> tab in RStudio or via the following function:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r">installed.packages()
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>As we move through this course, we will learn more about packages and keep adding them to our toolbox.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- **Note that in this course (at least, on most browsers), grey boxes are used to show R code typed into the R console.

&lt;h2 id="getting-started">Getting started with R and RStudio&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>R is not a programming language like &lt;code>C&lt;/code> or &lt;code>Java&lt;/code>. It was not created by software engineers for software development. Instead, it was developed by statisticians as an interactive environment for data analysis. This interactivity makes it easy to explore data quickly, which is an indispensable feature for many tasks in business analytics, statistics, data science, and other fields.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have prior programming experience, you may be surprised by differences between R and other programming languages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have no prior programming experience, you may initially be frustrated when learning R. That is normal! Learning to program is essentially learning to speak a new language. But in some ways it&amp;rsquo;s even more difficult, because your interlocutor is a computer who isn&amp;rsquo;t always great at telling you when you said something that made no sense.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Regardless of your prior experience, if you are patient, you will come to appreciate the power of R for data analysis and data visualization.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- However, like in other programming languages, you can save your work as scripts that can be easily executed at any moment. These scripts serve as a record of the analysis you performed, a key feature that facilitates reproducible work. -->
&lt;h2 id="r-and-the-r-console">R, and the R console&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can think of R analogously to the engine in a car: it will power our work. One way to control that engine is to use the &lt;em>R console&lt;/em> to execute commands as you type them, or to run scripts you have already written. There are several ways to gain access to the R console. One way is to install R on your computer and open the built-in console, which looks like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/example/images/01/Rconsole.png" alt="Rconsole" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, most people don&amp;rsquo;t use this console. Instead, they use an &lt;em>integrated development environment&lt;/em> (or IDE) to write, debug, and execute their code.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="rstudio">RStudio&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The IDE we will use in this class is RStudio. RStudio includes an editor with many R-specific features, a console to execute your code, and other useful panes, including one to show figures or view html documents you produce. RStudio looks like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/example/images/01/rstudio.png" alt="rstudio" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>RStudio will be our launching pad for data science projects. You can think of it as the dashboard in your car. It not only provides an editor for us to create and edit our scripts but also provides many other useful tools. In this section, we go over some of the basics.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="rstudio-panes">RStudio panes&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When you start RStudio for the first time, you will see three panes by default. The left pane shows the R console. On the right, the top pane includes tabs such as &lt;em>Environment&lt;/em> and &lt;em>History&lt;/em>, while the bottom pane shows five tabs: &lt;em>File&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Plots&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Packages&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Help&lt;/em>, and &lt;em>Viewer&lt;/em> (these tabs may change in new versions). You can click on each tab to move across the different features.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To start a new R script, you can click on File, then New File, then R Script.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This starts a new pane on the left and it is here where you can start writing your script.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="keyboard-shortcuts">Keyboard shortcuts&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Many tasks we perform with the mouse can be achieved with a combination of key strokes instead, or keyboard shortcuts For example, we just showed how to use the mouse to start a new script, but you can also use a shortcut: Ctrl+⇧+N on Windows and ⌘+⇧+N on macs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although using the mouse to explore RStudio&amp;rsquo;s dropdown menus is a good place to start, &lt;strong>I highly recommend that you memorize key bindings for the operations you use most&lt;/strong>. RStudio provides a useful cheat sheet with the most widely used commands. If you&amp;rsquo;re on a mac, you can access a list of keyboard by pressing ⌥+⇧+K. You might want to keep this in mind so you can look up keyboard shortcuts when you find yourself doing the same point-and-click operations repeatedly.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="tab-completion">Tab completion&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>One advantage of using RStudio is that it has context-aware tab completion. This means that when you start typing the name of a package, function, or object you want to use, RStudio will automatically suggest ways to complete your input. You can take advantage of this by scrolling through the suggestions using up/down arrows and hitting tab to use the selected completion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>RStudio also does handy things like adding a close parentheses when you type an open parentheses, such as if you type &lt;code>library(&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="running-commands-while-editing-scripts">Running commands while editing scripts&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There are many editors specifically made for coding. These are useful because color and indentation are automatically added to make code more readable. RStudio is one of these editors, and it was specifically developed for R. One of the main advantages provided by RStudio over other editors is that we can test our code easily as we edit our scripts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can see this by opening a new script. Give the script a name. You can do this through the editor by saving the current new unnamed script. To do this, click on the save icon or use the key binding Ctrl+S on Windows and ⌘+S on the Mac.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you ask for the document to be saved for the first time, RStudio will prompt you for a name. A good convention is to use a descriptive name, with lower case letters, no spaces, only hyphens to separate words, and then followed by the suffix &lt;em>.R&lt;/em>. Call your script &lt;em>my-first-script.R&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now we are ready to start editing our first script. For example, you could write:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r">print(&amp;quot;welcome to RStudio&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>If you do this and hit ↩ in the editor, nothing will happen in the console.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To &lt;em>execute&lt;/em> your new script, you can click on the &lt;em>Run&lt;/em> button on the upper right side of the editing pane or use the keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+⇧+↩ on Windows or ⌘+⇧+↩ on Mac. When you do this, the console will show the command as well as its output:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>## [1] &amp;quot;welcome to RStudio&amp;quot;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>To run one line at a time instead of the entire script, you can use Ctrl+↩ on Windows and ⌘+↩ on Mac.&lt;/p>

&lt;!-- **SETUP TIP** -->
&lt;!-- Change the option _Save workspace to .RData on exit_ to _Never_ and uncheck the _Restore .RData into workspace at start_. By default, when you exit R saves all the objects you have created into a file called .RData. This is done so that when you restart the session in the same folder, it will load these objects. I find that this causes confusion especially when sharing code with colleagues or peers. -->
&lt;!-- ::: -->
&lt;h2 id="quarto--r-markdown">Quarto / R Markdown&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Note: Quarto is a new authoring framework that builds on R Markdown so if you are familiar with R Markdown it should be pretty easy to transition to Quarto.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Quarto provides a unified authoring framework for data science that combines your code, its results, and your prose commentary. Quarto documents are fully reproducible and support dozens of output formats, like PDFs, Word files, slideshows, and more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Quarto files are designed to be used in three ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>For communicating to decision makers, who want to focus on the conclusions, not the code behind the analysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>For collaborating with others (including future you!) who are interested in your conclusions &lt;em>and&lt;/em> how you reached them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>As an environment in which to &lt;em>do&lt;/em> business analytics, where you can capture not only what you did, but also what you were thinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>All three of these are relevant for this course. Hopefully you can see how the first could be useful in business settings where you need to present a summary of ideas or findings to a decision maker.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://quarto.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quarto.org&lt;/a> provides many more resources to help you as you begin to work with Quarto.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You may also find the &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/rmarkdown.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rmarkdown cheatsheet&lt;/a> helpful since much of it also applies to Quarto.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="quarto-basics">Quarto basics&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Quarto files contain three types of content:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>An (optional) &lt;strong>YAML header&lt;/strong> surrounded by &lt;code>---&lt;/code>s.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Chunks&lt;/strong> of R code surrounded by &lt;code>```&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Text mixed with simple text formatting like &lt;code># heading&lt;/code> and &lt;code>_italics_&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>You can edit each of these to affect the final output.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you are done composing your document, you can &lt;strong>render&lt;/strong> it by clicking Render or by using the keyboard shorcut ⌘+⇧+K. This will process the file through several steps to produce your output in the format you specify.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="markdown-basics">Markdown basics&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Markdown is a set of formatting conventions for plain text files that is widely used (beyond R). We will use an example file on RStudio Cloud to learn about some basic text formatting using Markdown. You can also read more about this in &lt;a href="https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto.html#sec-source-editor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">R for Data Science (2e)&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- **Note that in this course (at least, on most browsers), grey boxes are used to show R code typed into the R console. The symbol `##` is used to denote what the R console outputs.** -->
&lt;h2 id="basic-base-r-slides">Basic base R slides&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For the rest of class we will discuss some basics of base R using slides accessible via these links: &lt;a href="https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/slides/01-2-slides.html">html&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/slides/01-2-slides.pdf">PDF&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Installing R, RStudio, tidyverse, rmarkdown, and tinytex</title><link>https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/resource/install/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/resource/install/</guid><description>&lt;p>You will do all of your work in this class with the open source (and free!) programming language &lt;a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">R&lt;/a>. You will use &lt;a href="https://www.rstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RStudio&lt;/a> as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard—R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="rstudiocloud">RStudio.cloud&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>R is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. To make life easier, this course uses &lt;a href="http://rstudio.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RStudio.cloud&lt;/a>, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This means you won&amp;rsquo;t have to install anything on your computer to get started with R! We have a shared class workspace in RStudio.cloud that will let you quickly copy templates for labs and problem sets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Go to &lt;a href="https://rstudio.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://rstudio.cloud/&lt;/a> and create an account. You&amp;rsquo;ll receive a link to join the shared class workspace separately. If you don&amp;rsquo;t get this link, let me know and I will invite you.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="rstudio-on-your-computer">RStudio on your computer&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>RStudio.cloud is convenient, but it can be slow and it is not designed to be able to handle larger datasets, more complicated analysis, or fancier graphics. Over the course of the semester, you might want to wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud and install all these things locally. This will also be handy in the future if you want to use R for other classes, jobs, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are some links to get set up for this class:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Go to the CRAN (Collective R Archive Network)&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> website: &lt;a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://cran.r-project.org/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Click on &amp;ldquo;Download R for &lt;code>XXX&lt;/code>&amp;rdquo;, where &lt;code>XXX&lt;/code> is your operating system:&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="img/install-r-links.png" width="60%" />
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If you use macOS, scroll down to the first &lt;code>.pkg&lt;/code> file in the list of files (in this picture, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>R-4.1.2.pkg&lt;/code>) and download it.&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="img/install-r-mac.png" width="60%" />
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If you use Windows, click &amp;ldquo;base&amp;rdquo; (or click on the bolded &amp;ldquo;install R for the first time&amp;rdquo; link) and download it.&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="img/install-r-windows.png" width="100%" />
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Double click on the downloaded file (check your &lt;code>Downloads&lt;/code> folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If you use macOS, &lt;a href="https://www.xquartz.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download and install XQuartz&lt;/a>.&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> You do not need to do this on Windows.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="install-rstudio">Install RStudio&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Next, you need to install RStudio (the dashboard). Once both R and RStudio are installed, you can ignore R and only use RStudio. RStudio will use R automatically and you won&amp;rsquo;t have to interact with R directly.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Go to the free download location on RStudio&amp;rsquo;s website: &lt;a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The website should automatically detect your operating system (macOS or Windows) and show a big download button for it. For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="img/install-r-rstudio1.png" width="50%" />
&lt;p>If not, scroll down a little to the large table and choose the version of RStudio that matches your operating system.&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="img/install-r-rstudio2.png" width="100%" />
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Double click on the downloaded file (again, check your &lt;code>Downloads&lt;/code> folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Double click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="install-tidyverse">Install &lt;code>tidyverse&lt;/code>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>R packages are easy to install with RStudio. There are multiple ways to do it. Here are two ways to install &lt;a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the tidyverse&lt;/a> and all its dependencies from CRAN:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Within RStudio, enter &lt;code>install.packages(&amp;quot;tidyverse&amp;quot;)&lt;/code> in the R console.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;img src="img/install-r-packages.png" width="50%" />
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>Select the packages panel, click on &amp;ldquo;Install,&amp;rdquo; type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;img src="img/install-r-package-panel.png" width="50%" />
&lt;img src="img/install-r-tidyverse.png" width="60%" />
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;ll see a bunch of output in the RStudio console as all the tidyverse packages and dependencies are installed. If you choose option 2, you might notice that RStudio implements your selection by generating the line of code &lt;code>install.packages(&amp;quot;tidyverse&amp;quot;)&lt;/code> and entering it in the console.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can use either of these methods to install additional packages for your work. Packages just need to be installed once per device (and then loaded each time you want to use them).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="install-rmarkdown">Install &lt;code>rmarkdown&lt;/code>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Follow your preferred procedure from above to install &lt;code>rmarkdown&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="install-tinytex">Install &lt;code>tinytex&lt;/code>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong> If you already have a LaTeX distribution installed on your device, you can skip this step.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you knit to PDF, R uses a special scientific typesetting program named LaTeX (pronounced &amp;ldquo;lay-tek&amp;rdquo;; for goofy nerdy reasons, the x is technically the &amp;ldquo;ch&amp;rdquo; sound in &amp;ldquo;Bach&amp;rdquo;, but most people just say it as &amp;ldquo;k&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>LaTeX is neat and makes pretty documents, but it&amp;rsquo;s a huge program—&lt;a href="https://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the macOS version, for instance, is over 4 GB&lt;/a>! To make life easier, there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://yihui.org/tinytex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an R package named &lt;strong>TinyTeX&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> that installs a minimal LaTeX program and that automatically deals with differences between macOS and Windows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s how to install &lt;strong>tinytex&lt;/strong> so you can knit to pretty PDFs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Use the Packages in panel in RStudio to install &lt;strong>tinytex&lt;/strong> like you did above with &lt;strong>tidyverse&lt;/strong>. Alternatively, run &lt;code>install.packages(&amp;quot;tinytex&amp;quot;)&lt;/code> in the console.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run &lt;code>tinytex::install_tinytex()&lt;/code> in the console.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wait for a bit while R downloads and installs everything you need.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The end! You should now be able to knit to PDF.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;h2 id="downloading-rstudio-cloud-projects">Downloading RStudio Cloud projects&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you want to use your local installation of R to complete assignments, all you need to do is navigate to the class workspace on RStudio Cloud and click the download arrow ⬇️ to the right of the project you would like to download.&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="img/download-cloud-project.png" width="80%" />
&lt;p>Once the project is prepared for export, click the Download button:&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="img/download-cloud-download.png" width="80%" />
&lt;p>This will download the entire project directory to your computer. The downloaded folder will have a name like &lt;code>3511792&lt;/code> (check your &lt;code>Downloads&lt;/code> folder). You can move and rename the folder as you wish. If you double-click the &lt;code>.Rproj&lt;/code> file within that directory, it will open an instance of RStudio on your machine with the working directory set to the project directory (either in your &lt;code>Downloads&lt;/code> or wherever you moved it). You can then work with the files included in the project directory just as if you were working on RStudio Cloud.&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>

&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Alternatively, you can do a &amp;ldquo;custom install&amp;rdquo; of R and skip installing XQuartz as described on the page &lt;a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">R for macOS&lt;/a>.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>R is fairly forgiving about how you type code (unlike other languages like Python, where miscounting spaces can ruin your code!). All of these things will do exactly the same thing:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r">mpg %&amp;gt;%
filter(cty &amp;gt; 10, class == &amp;quot;compact&amp;quot;)
mpg %&amp;gt;% filter(cty &amp;gt; 10, class == &amp;quot;compact&amp;quot;)
mpg %&amp;gt;%
filter(cty &amp;gt; 10,
class == &amp;quot;compact&amp;quot;)
mpg %&amp;gt;% filter(cty&amp;gt;10, class==&amp;quot;compact&amp;quot;)
filter(mpg,cty&amp;gt;10,class==&amp;quot;compact&amp;quot;)
mpg %&amp;gt;%
filter(cty &amp;gt; 10,
class == &amp;quot;compact&amp;quot;)
filter ( mpg,cty&amp;gt;10, class==&amp;quot;compact&amp;quot; )
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>But you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that only a few of those iterations (the first three) are easily readable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To help improve readability and make it easier to share code with others, there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an unofficial style guide for writing R code&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s fairly short and just has lots of examples of good and bad ways of writing code (naming variables, dealing with long lines, using proper indentation levels, etc.)—you should glance through it some time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>RStudio has a built-in way of cleaning up your code. Select some code, press &lt;kbd>ctrl&lt;/kbd> + &lt;kbd>i&lt;/kbd> (on Windows) or &lt;kbd>⌘&lt;/kbd> + &lt;kbd>i&lt;/kbd> (on macOS), and R will reformat the code for you. It&amp;rsquo;s not always perfect, but it&amp;rsquo;s really helpful for getting indentation right without having to manually hit &lt;kbd>space&lt;/kbd> a billion times.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="main-style-things-to-pay-attention-to-for-this-class">Main style things to pay attention to for this class&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Note&lt;/em>: We won&amp;rsquo;t grade you on this! If you submit something like &lt;code>filter(mpg,cty&amp;gt;10,class==&amp;quot;compact&amp;quot;)&lt;/code>, we might recommend adding spaces, but we won&amp;rsquo;t take points off.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="spacing">Spacing&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>See the &lt;a href="https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#spacing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&amp;ldquo;Spacing&amp;rdquo; section&lt;/a> in the tidyverse style guide.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Put spaces after commas (like in regular English):&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r"># Good
filter(mpg, cty &amp;gt; 10)
# Bad
filter(mpg,cty &amp;gt; 10)
filter(mpg ,cty &amp;gt; 10)
filter(mpg , cty &amp;gt; 10)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Put spaces around operators like &lt;code>+&lt;/code>, &lt;code>-&lt;/code>, &lt;code>&amp;gt;&lt;/code>, &lt;code>=&lt;/code>, etc.:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r"># Good
filter(mpg, cty &amp;gt; 10)
# Bad
filter(mpg, cty&amp;gt;10)
filter(mpg, cty&amp;gt; 10)
filter(mpg, cty &amp;gt;10)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t put spaces around parentheses that are parts of functions:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r"># Good
filter(mpg, cty &amp;gt; 10)
# Bad
filter (mpg, cty &amp;gt; 10)
filter ( mpg, cty &amp;gt; 10)
filter( mpg, cty &amp;gt; 10 )
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h3 id="long-lines">Long lines&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>See the &lt;a href="https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#long-lines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&amp;ldquo;Long lines&amp;rdquo; section&lt;/a> in the tidyverse style guide.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s good practice to make sure your lines of code don&amp;rsquo;t get too long. A good suggestion is to keep lines at a maximum of 80 characters. Instead of counting characters by hand (🥴), in RStudio go to &amp;ldquo;Tools&amp;rdquo; &amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Global Options&amp;rdquo; &amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Code&amp;rdquo; &amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Display&amp;rdquo; and check the box for &amp;ldquo;Show margin.&amp;rdquo; You should now see a really thin line indicating 80 characters. Again, you can go beyond this—that&amp;rsquo;s fine. It&amp;rsquo;s just good practice to avoid going too far past it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can add line breaks inside longer lines of code. Line breaks should come after commas, and things like function arguments should align within the function:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r"># Good
filter(mpg, cty &amp;gt; 10, class == &amp;quot;compact&amp;quot;)
# Good
filter(mpg, cty &amp;gt; 10,
class == &amp;quot;compact&amp;quot;)
# Good
filter(mpg,
cty &amp;gt; 10,
class == &amp;quot;compact&amp;quot;)
# Bad
filter(mpg, cty &amp;gt; 10, class %in% c(&amp;quot;compact&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;pickup&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;midsize&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;subcompact&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;suv&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;2seater&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;minivan&amp;quot;))
# Good
filter(mpg,
cty &amp;gt; 10,
class %in% c(&amp;quot;compact&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;pickup&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;midsize&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;subcompact&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;suv&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;2seater&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;minivan&amp;quot;))
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h3 id="pipes--and-ggplot-layers-">Pipes (&lt;code>%&amp;gt;%&lt;/code>) and ggplot layers (&lt;code>+&lt;/code>)&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Put each step in a dplyr pipeline on separate lines, with the &lt;code>%&amp;gt;%&lt;/code> at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r"># Good
mpg %&amp;gt;%
filter(cty &amp;gt; 10) %&amp;gt;%
group_by(class) %&amp;gt;%
summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))
# Bad
mpg %&amp;gt;% filter(cty &amp;gt; 10) %&amp;gt;% group_by(class) %&amp;gt;%
summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))
# Super bad
mpg %&amp;gt;% filter(cty &amp;gt; 10) %&amp;gt;% group_by(class) %&amp;gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))
# Super bad and won't even work
mpg %&amp;gt;%
filter(cty &amp;gt; 10)
%&amp;gt;% group_by(class)
%&amp;gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Put each layer of a ggplot plot on separate lines, with the &lt;code>+&lt;/code> at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r"># Good
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) +
geom_point() +
geom_smooth() +
theme_bw()
# Bad
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) +
geom_point() + geom_smooth() +
theme_bw()
# Super bad
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw()
# Super bad and won't even work
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class))
+ geom_point()
+ geom_smooth()
+ theme_bw()
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h3 id="comments">Comments&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>See the &lt;a href="https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#comments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&amp;ldquo;Comments&amp;rdquo; section&lt;/a> in the tidyverse style guide.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Comments should start with a comment symbol and a single space: &lt;code># &lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r"># Good
#Bad
#Bad
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>If the comment is really short (and won&amp;rsquo;t cause you to go over 80 characters in the line), you can include it in the same line as the code:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r">mpg %&amp;gt;%
filter(cty &amp;gt; 10) %&amp;gt;% # Only rows where cty is 10 +
group_by(class) %&amp;gt;% # Divide into class groups
summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Find the average hwy in each group
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>You can add extra spaces to get inline comments to align, if you want:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r">mpg %&amp;gt;%
filter(cty &amp;gt; 10) %&amp;gt;% # Only rows where cty is 10 +
group_by(class) %&amp;gt;% # Divide into class groups
summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Find the average hwy in each group
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>If the comment is really long, you can break it into multiple lines. RStudio can do this for you if you go to &amp;ldquo;Code&amp;rdquo; &amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Reflow comment&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code class="language-r"># Good
