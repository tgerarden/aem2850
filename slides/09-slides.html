- Stacked curves makes it hard to see trends for females
- Legend could be bigger and use "Male" and "Female"
- x-axis labeling: use labels every 10 or 20 years (not 4!)
- y-axis labeling:
  - multiples of 4 are not intuitive
  - %s would be easier to interpret

# Don't be too extreme!

When discussing amounts, we said to never truncate the y-axis

But it is actually more legal to truncate the y-axis than you might think

When do you think it is okay to truncate?

--

- When small movements matter

--

- When the scale itself is distorted

--

- When zero values are impossible

# Visualizing time: the basics

# Visualizing amounts over time

Time is just a variable that can be mapped to an aesthetic

--

Can be used as `x`, `y`, `color`, `fill`, `facet`, and even animation

--

Can use all sorts of `geom`s: lines, columns, points, heatmaps, densities, maps, etc.

--

In general, follow reading conventions to show time progression:

# Visualizing amounts over time using ggplot

Let's use GameStop share prices to make some plots:


```r
gme_prices
```

```
## # A tibble: 5,060 × 8
##    symbol date        open  high   low close   volume adjusted
##    &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;

How would you use these data to plot `adjusted` prices over time?


---

# Time on x-axis + `geom_point()`

.left-code[

```r
gme_prices |&gt; 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = adjusted)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Share price ($)",
       title = "GME to the moon")
```
How could you reduce point overlap?
]

.right-plot[

# Time on x-axis + `geom_point()`

gme_prices |&gt; 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = adjusted)) +
* geom_point(size = 0.5) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Share price ($)",
       title = "GME to the moon")
```
How could you add a line to this?

  geom_point(size = 0.5) +
* geom_line() +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Share price ($)",
       title = "GME to the moon")
```
Which is better, points or lines?
]

.right-plot[
![](09-slides_files/figure-html/gme-point-line-1.png)
]


---

# Time on x-axis: points vs lines

It depends!

Points emphasize observations

Lines emphasize trends

Using lines for time series is often fine since data are evenly spaced and usually complete

But lines are effectively made-up data, so be careful how you use them!

---

# Time on x-axis + `geom_line/col()`

The GameStop share price plot is clearer without points:

.left-code[

```r
gme_prices |&gt; 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = adjusted)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Share price ($)",
       title = "GME to the moon")
```
]

.right-plot[
![](09-slides_files/figure-html/gme-1.png)
]


---

# Time on x-axis + `geom_line/col()`

Can also use a fill for the area under a line, **as long as the y-axis starts at zero**

.left-code[

```r
gme_prices |&gt; 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = adjusted)) +
* geom_area(fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Share price ($)",
       title = "GME to the moon")
```

# Dates and times in R

---

# Are dates and times special?

We just made some plots without really thinking about data types

We can map "dates" to x regardless of whether they are `date` or `numeric` objects

When do we need to pay attention to the details?

--

1. Converting from strings to dates

--

2. Getting components of date-time data

--

3. Computing time spans

---

# Dates and times in R

R has "native" classes for storing calendar dates and times

- For background, see `?Dates` and `?DateTimeClasses`

--

The `lubridate` package offers convenient tools for working with dates and times

- Loaded automatically as part of the core tidyverse since tidyverse 2.0.0
- See [Chapter 17 of R4DS (2e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/datetimes.html)

---

# Converting from strings to dates

Use `lubridate::ymd` to parse dates with **y**ear, **m**onth, and **d**ay components


```r
svb_failure &lt;- ymd("2023-03-10")
svb_failure
```

```
## [1] "2023-03-10"
```

--

.pull-left[

```r
class(svb_failure)
```

```
## [1] "Date"
```
]

.pull-right[

```r
class("2023-03-10")
```

```
## [1] "character"
```
]

---

# Converting from strings to dates

`lubridate` offers many other functions for parsing dates

For example, instead of `ymd` we could use `mdy`:


```r
signature_failure &lt;- mdy("March 12, 2023")
```

.pull-left[

```r
signature_failure
```

```
## [1] "2023-03-12"
```
]

.pull-right[

```r
class(signature_failure)
```

```
## [1] "Date"
```
]

# Getting components of date-time data

What year did Silicon Valley Bank fail?

```r

```r

```

```

```r

```

```
## [1] Fri
## Levels: Sun &lt; Mon &lt; Tue &lt; Wed &lt; Thu &lt; Fri &lt; Sat
```
]

--

.pull-right[
What month was that?


```r
month(svb_failure)
```

```
## [1] 3
```

```r
month(svb_failure, label = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] Mar
## 12 Levels: Jan &lt; Feb &lt; Mar &lt; Apr &lt; May &lt; Jun &lt; Jul &lt; Aug &lt; Sep &lt; ... &lt; Dec
```
]

---

# Computing time spans

How many days passed between the failures of SVB and Signature?

```r
signature_failure - svb_failure
```

```
## Time difference of 2 days
```

--

How many days are left until classes end?

```r
ymd(20240507) - today()
```

```
## Time difference of 50 days
```

--

These are **durations**

See [Chapter 17 of R4DS (2e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/datetimes.html) for functions to compute **periods** and **intervals**

      color = "white", 
      quantile_lines = TRUE,

# Converting a static plot to an animation

Second, let's use `gganimate` to visualize changes over time

.left-code[

```r
*library(gganimate) # plot animation package

gapminder |&gt; 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, 
             size = pop, color = continent)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_color_manual(

  theme_classic(base_size = 20) +
  labs(x = "GDP per capita",

# Saving gifs

Third, use `anim_save()` to write a `.gif` that you can text to your mom


```r
library(gganimate)
library(gifski)

my_gapminder_animation &lt;- gapminder |&gt; 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, color = continent)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_color_manual(values = gapminder::continent_colors) +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(1, 15)) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = label_dollar()) +
  theme_classic(base_size = 20) +
  labs(x = "GDP per capita", 
       y = "Life expectancy",
       title = "Year: {frame_time}") +
  transition_time(year) +
  ease_aes('linear')

*animate(my_gapminder_animation, renderer = gifski_renderer())
*anim_save("content/slides/img/09/my-gapminder-animation.gif")

Looks a lot like a demand curve!

`\(log(Q) = \alpha + \beta log(P) + \varepsilon\)`

We could use regression to estimate `\(\beta\)`

How might we interpret `\(\beta\)`?
